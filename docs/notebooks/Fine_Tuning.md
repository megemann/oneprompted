# Step 3 & 5
## Fine Tune model using Vertex AI:
    - No notebook associated with this
    - Exported files from '/data/Prompt_Training/vertex_ai_fine_tuning_*' to Google Cloud
    - Also exported files from '/data/Prompt_Training_2.0/vertex_ai_fine_tuning_*'
    - Fine tuned using the 'train' dataset, created a validation split for validation.
    - For V2, created seperate datasets for validation and train
    - Training Images available in Images
    - V1 Model not deployed anymore to save resources, V2 Model deployed to endpoint
