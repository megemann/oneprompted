# Responses

## Base Model Responses
Base model responses contain prompts improved by Gemini 2.0 and the corresponding model responses to these improved prompts. The base model serves as the foundation for prompt enhancement without specialized fine-tuning.

### improved_prompts.csv
This file contains the original prompts and the enhanced versions generated by the base model.
- `original_prompt`: The raw user query
- `base_response`: The improved prompt generated by the base model
- `context`: Additional context for the prompt (may be NaN)
- `instruction`: The instruction to be followed
- `has_context`: Boolean indicating whether context is available
- `conversation_id`: Unique identifier for the conversation

### responses.csv
This file contains the responses generated by Gemini 2.0 to the improved prompts.
- `original_prompt`: The original user query
- `base_prompt`: The improved prompt generated by the base model
- `response`: The model's response to the improved prompt
- `context`: Additional context (may be NaN)
- `instruction`: The original instruction
- `has_context`: Boolean indicating whether context is available
- `conversation_id`: Unique identifier for the conversation

## FineTunedV1Responses
The V1 fine-tuned model responses contain prompts improved by the first version of our fine-tuned model and the corresponding responses. This version focuses on improving prompts without explicitly handling context.

- `instruction`: The original instruction
- `has_context`: Boolean indicating whether context is available
- `conversation_id`: Unique identifier for the conversation

### responses.csv
Contains the responses to the prompts enhanced by the V1 fine-tuned model.

- `fine_tuned_prompt`: The improved prompt generated by the V1 fine-tuned model
- `response`: The model's response to the fine-tuned prompt
- `context`: Additional context (may be NaN)
- `instruction`: The original instruction
- `has_context`: Boolean indicating whether context is available
- `conversation_id`: Unique identifier for the conversation

## FineTunedV2Responses
V2 fine-tuned model responses contain prompts improved by the second version of our fine-tuned model, which better incorporates context, and the corresponding responses to these prompts.

### improved_prompts.csv
Contains the original instructions, context, and the enhanced instructions from the V2 fine-tuned model.
- `fine_tuned_instruction`: The improved instruction generated by the V2 fine-tuned model
- `instruction`: The original instruction
- `context`: Additional context information (may be NaN)
- `has_context`: Boolean indicating whether context is available
- `conversation_id`: Unique identifier for the conversation

### responses.csv
Contains the responses to the instructions enhanced by the V2 fine-tuned model.
- `fine_tuned_instruction`: The improved instruction generated by the V2 fine-tuned model
- `response`: The model's response to the fine-tuned instruction
- `instruction`: The original instruction
- `context`: Additional context (may be NaN)
- `has_context`: Boolean indicating whether context is available
- `conversation_id`: Unique identifier for the conversation

## NoModelResponses
Control group responses generated by submitting the original prompts directly to the model without any enhancement, serving as a baseline for comparison.

### responses.csv
Contains responses to the original prompts without any enhancement.
- `original_prompt`: The original user query
- `response`: The model's response to the original prompt without enhancement
- `context`: Additional context (may be NaN)
- `instruction`: The original instruction
- `has_context`: Boolean indicating whether context is available
- `conversation_id`: Unique identifier for the conversation
- `base_prompt`: The original prompt (for consistency in schema)

## Prompt_Examples

## Example Comparison

### Original Prompt
"One-pot vegetarian pasta recipes for busy nights"

### Base Model Enhanced Prompt
"Create a list of five (5) unique one-pot vegetarian pasta recipes for busy nights. For each recipe, include a descriptive title, a brief list of ingredients, and simple cooking instructions that can be completed in under 30 minutes."

### V1 Fine-Tuned Enhanced Prompt
"I am looking for one-pot vegetarian pasta recipes that can be prepared quickly on busy weeknights. Please provide 3-5 recipes that are completely vegetarian, use only one pot, and can be prepared in under 30 minutes."

### V2 Fine-Tuned Enhanced Instruction
"Generate a numbered list of 5-7 one-pot vegetarian pasta recipes specifically designed for busy weeknights. For each recipe, include a descriptive name, total preparation time, ingredients with measurements, and step-by-step cooking instructions."
