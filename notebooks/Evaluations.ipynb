      "I hope this email finds you well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, I want to discuss the importance of web accessibility for your website.\n",
      "With over a billion people worldwide living with disabilities, it's crucial that we create websites that are easy to use for everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Web accessibility means designing and developing websites that can be used by people with disabilities,\n",
      "such as those who are blind, deaf, or have limited mobility.\n",
      "\n",
      "This involves creating content that can be easily accessed using assistive technologies, such as screen readers or keyboard-only navigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several benefits to creating an accessible website.\n",
      "For one, it ensures that your website is inclusive and reaches the broadest possible audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also helps you comply with accessibility laws and regulations, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),\n",
      "which requires businesses to provide equal access to their goods and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, an accessible website can improve the user experience for all users, not just those with disabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can make your website more user-friendly, faster to navigate, and easier to use across different devices and platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this email series, we'll cover the basics of web accessibility and how it can benefit your website and your users.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope that you find this information helpful and informative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\n",

      "2.  Express interest in learning more about the specific strategies and tools for implementing web accessibility on your website.\n",
      "3.  Provide three concrete, actionable steps that Jacob can take to improve the accessibility of his website immediately.\n",
      "4.  Ask for links to resources or further information about web accessibility best practices and compliance with ADA regulations.\n",

      "Create a JavaScript class named \"GraphicLayer\" designed for dynamic image placement within a parent HTML element.\n",

      "**Class Constructor:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The constructor should accept the following arguments:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  `parentElement`:  A reference to the parent HTML element (e.g., `<div>`). This element will serve as the container for the image.\n",
      "2.  `imageSource`:  Either an HTML `<img>` element OR a string representing the URL of an image. If a URL is provided, the constructor should create a new `<img>` element and set its `src` attribute to the URL.\n",
      "3.  `properties` (Object): An optional object containing placement and sizing information for the image.  It should include the following:\n",
      "    *   `centerPoint`:  An object with `x` and `y` properties (numbers between 0 and 1) defining the image's center point relative to the parent.  Values represent percentages: `x: 0.5, y: 0.5` centers the image; `x: 0, y: 0` places the top-left corner of the image at the top-left corner of the parent. Defaults to `{ x: 0.5, y: 0.5 }` if not provided.\n",
      "    *   `size`:  An object with `width` and `height` properties (numbers between 0 and 1) defining the image's size relative to the parent. Values represent percentages of the parent's width or height, maintaining the aspect ratio of the image.  A value of `1` represents 100% of the parent's relevant dimension (width or height, whichever is smaller to ensure the whole image is visible).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Methods:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  `adjustPositionAndSize()`: This method should calculate and apply the necessary CSS `top`, `left`, `width`, and `height` styles to the image element to position and size it based on the `centerPoint`, `size`, and parent element dimensions. This method MUST NOT use CSS `transform`.
