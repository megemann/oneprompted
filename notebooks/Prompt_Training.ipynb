Human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. This leads to enhanced warming. Observed impacts include rising global temperatures, sea-level rise, and more frequent extreme weather events.
