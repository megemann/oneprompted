Grade the implementation rigorously against senior undergraduate standards on a scale of 0-100 points.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1.  **Immutability (15 pts):** Verify that the `Fraction` instances are truly immutable (e.g., `readonly` fields, no methods modifying state).
2.  **Constructor Logic (15 pts):**
    *   Correct handling of zero denominator (e.g., throws appropriate exception).
    *   Normalization: Ensures denominator is always positive.
    *   Normalization: Simplifies fractions using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) upon creation.
    *   Correct initialization of numerator and denominator.
3.  **Operator Overloading Correctness (40 pts):**
    *   Arithmetic Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`): Correct mathematical implementation and handling of resulting fractions (15 pts).
    *   Comparison Operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`): Correct logical implementation for comparing potentially un-normalized intermediate values if applicable, or relies correctly on normalized state (15 pts).
    *   Unary Negation Operator (`-`): Correct implementation (5 pts).
    *   Consistency between `Equals(object obj)` override and `operator ==` (5 pts).
4.  **Conversion Operators (if implemented) (10 pts):**
    *   Evaluate the correctness and appropriateness of any implicit/explicit conversion operators (e.g., to/from `int`, `double`). Assess potential precision issues or invalid cast scenarios.
5.  **Code Quality & Robustness (20 pts):**
    *   Readability, Style, Naming Conventions, and appropriate use of C# features (5 pts).
    *   Correct implementation and usage of `Equals(object obj)` and `GetHashCode()` (Crucial for correctness when `Equals` is overridden; ensure hash codes are consistent with equality) (10 pts).
    *   Handling potential edge cases beyond zero denominator (e.g., operations involving zero numerator) (5 pts).

1.  **Core Concept & Purpose:**
    *   Define what a copy constructor is.
    *   Explain *why* it is necessary in C++ (its primary role in object initialization from another object).
    *   Describe the specific signature/syntax of a copy constructor.

2.  **Compiler-Generated (Implicit) Copy Constructor:**

Dear John,

 

I note that on 8 February 2023 the matter had its first day of hearing and is listed for a further date of 4 April 2023. I confirm that I am available for the second day.

 

Day one – expert evidence

As you are aware, on the first day only the examination of the experts was undertaken and no lay witness was examined. While unfortunate as it has caused an increase in costs to the parties, ultimately, it may be a blessing in disguise. While it is true that both experts did make some concessions, it is clear upon reflection that the Builder’s expert came across better.

 

 

It became clear that the Builders expert deliberately did not provide an opinion as to the material costs for carpentry, electrical and  plumbing as he considered that this was not accounted for by Mr Kyle (except with the latter two where some was claimed as consumables).

 

Arron Kyle’s change of opinion evidence

I understand that upon reflection following the evidence given, that he has changed his view as expressed in his earlier report about the value of the incomplete works. His change of view relates to the fact that the cost of materials for carpentry works was not adequately included. Accordingly, he considers that he is obliged to prepare further evidence addressing this issue. 

 

This is not an ideal situation.  Ideally an expert would provide his opinion on all relevant issues within their area of expertise at the time of preparing his report. This will likely cause an increase in costs to both parties as for the Builder would likely need to respond to this new evidence if it is accepted. There may be cost consequences for the client to account for the builders additionally incurred costs.

 

There is also the possibility that the Tribunal will not admit the evidence at all (which could potentially be an appeal point). There is also the risk that it may adversely effect the weight the tribunal gives to Mr Kyle’s evidence (though that could also go the other way as it shows adherence to the code of conduct).

 

Ultimately, the code of conduct obliges an expert to prepare a report if they change their view, in that sense it is out of our hands as it relates to the independence of the expert.

 

Going forward

I see little choice but other than to serve the update of Aaron Kyle once available. Indeed, the code of conduct obliges him to prepare a supplementary report in the event that he has changed his mind. This will likely be the subject of an objection from the Builder; particularly as it would require further evidence from the Builder’s expert and likely would require the experts to be recalled.  While there would be some force in the objection (given that the expert evidence was considered ‘complete’), it may well be that the ‘prejudice’ suffered by the Builder would be overcome with appropriate cost orders. I do note that the Builder’s expert did not (seemingly tactically) respond to the materials aspect of Carpentry, Plumbing and electrical components of the incomplete works claim. So in that sense there has been no evidence on this point and the omission is by both experts. The real risk in not serving the evidence (if this was an option, but given it’s a change of opinion report), would be that it could undermine the credibility of the expert in terms of his evidence. While this is a risk, I do not consider that this is likely to substantially change the position one way or another after the evidence that was given to date. 

 

Again, I see no reasonable alternative, there is no real dilemma, the report should be served as soon as its finalised and force the Builder to either raise an objection or take the bait and go into evidence on this topic (which will cause an increase in his estimate).


Invoices for work completed to date

I enclose my invoices for work completed to date. I have separately invoiced for the work related to the adjournment and the late served evidence of the Builder in case this is ultimately subject to different costs orders. I have also included some time in post-hearing conferences regarding Mr Kyle’s evidence. As always, if you have any questions, please to not hesitate to contract.

 

Fee estimate for further work

I note that the matter is listed for a further day of hearing and that it is anticipated that the written submissions will be required. While I do have a draft written submissions prepared, they will need to be updated in light of the evidence of day 1 and, likely supplemented from the evidence from day two prior to completion. There may also be scope for reply submissions. There is the possibility that the matter may be brought back for directions now in order to deal with Aarron Kyle’s update evidence and if permitted it may require further evidence from the Builder.  I account for my update submissions as part of my hearing preparation, thought I will likely complete this work now (in February) while the matter is fresh in my memory. I accordingly,  provide the following estimate for work to be completed after today:

"Ms Diana Anon and Mr Marvin Smith jointly own a two roomed flat at 15 Tolworth Court, Surbiton. There is a mortgage outstanding with Crusty Bank. They used to live as a couple but for three years now they have been estranged. Circumstances have required each of them to remain living at 15 Tolworth Court. 

Although they agreed the flat would be sold so that they could properly finally separate this has not happened because there have been unauthorised changes made without the necessary planning permission and performed by Mr Smith to the internal layout of the flat and the flat is now difficult to sell as a consequence. Also it has become apparent over the three years that Mr Smith is actually reluctant to sell the flat and this has eventually forced Ms Anon to apply recently to the courts for an order to force the sale of the flat. 

In recent days, for reasons unknown, but presumably to force Ms Anon to leave the flat, Mr Smith has disconnected the utilities leaving the flat without heating, light or power. He has also removed all the internal doors including the bathroom door meaning there is no privacy for Ms Anon in the flat. He has also removed the kitchen cupboard doors. Effectively he is damaging the flat, their common property, making the sale impossible, and he has forced Ms Anon to leave the flat, her home.

Mr Smith has also become increasingly hostile verbally aggressive to Ms Anon to the point she now fears for her physical safety.

The expenses of suddenly having to leave home and now pay rent on a new home means that Ms Anon is unable to pay her share of the mortgage payments. Please write a letter explaining all this to Crusty Bank.","Ms Diana Anon and Mr Marvin Smith jointly own a two roomed flat at 15 Tolworth Court, Surbiton.

**Objective:** Inform the bank about critical circumstances that have (1) damaged the property securing the loan, (2) rendered it uninhabitable and unsellable in its current state, (3) forced Ms. Anon to vacate the property, and (4) resulted in her inability to meet her upcoming mortgage payment obligations.

**Tone:** Urgent, factual, professional, and concerned.

**Key Information to Convey:**

1.  **Identify:** State the property address, acknowledge the joint mortgage with Mr. Marvin Smith, and provide the mortgage account number.
2.  **Background:** Briefly explain that although estranged, Ms. Anon and Mr. Smith have been cohabiting, and an agreement to sell the property exists but has been stalled due to Mr. Smith's actions (unauthorised alterations hindering sale, general reluctance) leading Ms. Anon to seek a court order for sale.
3.  **Escalation & Damage:** Detail Mr. Smith's recent hostile actions: intentionally disconnecting all utilities (heating, light, power) and removing all internal doors (including bathroom and kitchen cupboards).

**Task:** Develop a complete PineScript v5 strategy script implementing a Bollinger Band mean reversion system with specific entry and exit criteria.

**Strategy Logic & Parameters:**

1.  **Indicator Setup:**
    *   Use Bollinger Bands with user-configurable inputs for `Length` (default: 20), `Standard Deviations` (default: 2), and `Source` (default: `close`).
    *   Plot the Bollinger Bands (Upper, Basis, Lower) on the chart.

2.  **Entry Conditions:**
    *   **Short Entry Signal:** Triggered when the `high` price of a bar touches or crosses *above* the Upper Bollinger Band.
    *   **Long Entry Signal:** Triggered when the `low` price of a bar touches or crosses *below* the Lower Bollinger Band.
    *   **Execution:** Enter the trade at the **close** of the bar where the signal occurs. Set `process_orders_on_close=true` in the `strategy` declaration.

3.  **Exit Conditions (Profit Target):**
    *   **Close Short:** Set a Take Profit target 0.5% *below* the short entry price (calculated as `entry_price * (1 - 0.005)`). Use `strategy.exit` with a `limit` parameter to place this order immediately upon entry, allowing for potential intra-bar exit if the target is hit.
    *   **Close Long:** Set a Take Profit target 0.5% *above* the long entry price (calculated as `entry_price * (1 + 0.005)`). Use `strategy.exit` with a `limit` parameter to place this order immediately upon entry, allowing for potential intra-bar exit if the target is hit.

    *   Ensure only **one** position (either long or short) is open at any time (`strategy.opentrades == 0` check before entry). Do not pyramid.
    *   Implement **no stop-loss** mechanism for this specific strategy version.

"I am working on the following extract from Gurdjieff:Certainly. What would you like to know about it?what does itaklanoz mean""Itaklanoz"" is a term coined by the philosopher and spiritual teacher G.I. Gurdjieff, and it refers to a state of consciousness in which a person is completely absorbed in their thoughts and feelings, and is completely disconnected from the present moment and their surroundings. It is a state of being ""lost in one's own thoughts,"" and is often associated with a lack of self-awareness and a lack of connection to others. Gurdjieff believed that itaklanoz was a common state of consciousness for many people, and that it was a major obstacle to spiritual growth and self-development.Let me give you the extract and we can work together from there.Certainly. I'll be happy to help in any way that I can. Please go ahead and provide the extract.Here it is:

30.504

“And these contemporary actors there first reproduce this work themselves alone, without strangers, and they reproduce it until it is exactly as the sick being himself has indicated and as the producer has ordered, and when finally their reproduction proceeds without the participation of their own consciousness and feelings and these contemporary actors themselves are completely transformed into what are called ‘living automatons,’ then and then only, with the help of those among them who have not yet become entirely living automatons—for which reason they later acquire the name of ‘stage managers’—they do the same thing under their direction, but already now in the presence of other ordinary beings assembled in these contemporary theaters.

30.504-5

“Thus you can now, from all I have just said, easily conclude that, besides many definitely maleficent consequences which I shall soon touch upon more in detail, these theaters cannot of course provide anything for that lofty aim which the Babylonian learned beings then had in view when they created for the first time such a form of conscious reproduction of perceptions and of the associative reactions to them of other beings similar to themselves.

30.505

“All the same, it must be admitted that from their theaters and from these contemporary actors of theirs they obtained, of course accidentally, for the processes of their ordinary being-existence one ‘not-bad-result.’

30.505

“To understand in what this ‘not-bad-result’ consists, I have first to explain another particularity which becomes proper to the common presence of beings who arise according to the principle Itoklanoz.

30.505

“In accordance with this principle, the forming in the presence of such beings of energy necessary for what is called their ‘waking state’ depends on the quality of the associations which proceed in their common presence during their ‘complete passivity’ or as those favorites of yours say, ‘during sleep’; and vice versa, that energy necessary for the ‘productiveness’ of this said ‘sleep,’ is formed in its turn also from the associative process proceeding in them during this waking state, which is dependent on the quality or intensity of their activity.This passage from Gurdjieff's writings describes the process of creating and performing a play or theater production, and how it relates to the concept of ""itaklanoz,"" or being lost in one's own thoughts and disconnected from the present moment. Gurdjieff argues that in the process of creating and performing a play, actors often become ""living automatons"" who are completely absorbed in their roles and lose touch with their own consciousness and feelings. He also suggests that this process of becoming a ""living automaton"" has some beneficial effects on the actors' ordinary waking lives, as it allows them to form the energy necessary for their ""waking state"" based on the quality of their associations during sleep. However, Gurdjieff ultimately argues that this process is not conducive to the ""lofty aim"" that the Babylonian learned beings had in mind when they first created theater, and that it has many ""maleficent consequences.""Thank you. Now a number of use listened to that extract in a meeting and provided responses. I need to pick out the parts of their responses which are relevant to the text. As I will need to summarise these in a blog which is a review of the meeting, please could you summarise it the responses for me, putting them in the third person and past tense. We will start with this response from a participant we will call J:

I would, I would actually sort of take issue with the basic principle behind this. And it's not a case of living automatons, because I think the good actor, throws himself into his role and imagines how he would act if he himself was that other actor. So you're not being an automaton you are doing it according to your own sort of roundtable vowel sounds or input impetus. So you got one that would apply all said, what you just said about the children, they bring their own being into the sort of screed of instructions. So it's not a case of automata. It's a case of sort of influenced training, I would have said, I mean, no, no, no actor is going to just turn on like a egg, like an AI almost and sort of be given that that sort of instruction, you will think and talk this sounds like way, we will come across as artificial.During the meeting, participant J argued against the idea that actors in theater productions become ""living automatons"" as described in the extract from Gurdjieff's writings. J argued that good actors do not simply become automatons, but rather they bring their own being into the role they are playing and use their own imagination and creativity to interpret the character and the script. J suggested that the process of acting is more about being influenced and trained, rather than becoming an automaton. J also pointed out that no actor would want to come across as artificial or lacking in authenticity, and that they would therefore not simply follow instructions without thinking or using their own judgment.Thank you, please stand by for more!Certainly. I'm here to help in any way that I can. Please don't hesitate to ask for further assistance.I have rephrased what you just wrote. Please fix any of my errors in grammar:

The process of acting was more about being influenced and trained, rather than becoming an automaton. No actor would want to come across as artificial or lacking in authenticity, and would therefore not simply follow instructions without thinking or using their own judgment.Your rephrasing looks good to me. The grammar is correct and the meaning of J's comments is accurately conveyed. Well done! Is there anything else I can help with?Thank you, please stand by.You're welcome. I'll be here if you have any further questions or need any further assistance.Thank you, I formulated my version as follows. What do you think?

J argued that the good actor does not simply become an automaton, but throws himself into his role  and imagines how he would act if he himself were that person. The process of acting was more about being influenced and trained. No actor would want to come across as artificial.Your summary of J's comments seems accurate and well-written. It accurately conveys the main points made by J, which were that good actors do not simply become automatons, but rather bring their own being into the role they are playing and use their imagination and creativity to interpret the character and the script. The process of acting is more about being influenced and trained, rather than becoming an automaton. Additionally, no actor would want to come across as artificial or lacking in authenticity. Overall, this summary effectively conveys the essence of J's comments on the topic. Is there anything else I can help with?No, that is all for now. Thanks for your help!You're welcome!

“And these contemporary actors there first reproduce this work themselves alone, without strangers, and they reproduce it until it is exactly as the sick being himself has indicated and as the producer has ordered, and when finally their reproduction proceeds without the participation of their own consciousness and feelings and these contemporary actors themselves are completely transformed into what are called ‘living automatons,’ then and then only, with the help of those among them who have not yet become entirely living automatons—for which reason they later acquire the name of ‘stage managers’—they do the same thing under their direction, but already now in the presence of other ordinary beings assembled in these contemporary theaters.

30.504-5

“Thus you can now, from all I have just said, easily conclude that, besides many definitely maleficent consequences which I shall soon touch upon more in detail, these theaters cannot of course provide anything for that lofty aim which the Babylonian learned beings then had in view when they created for the first time such a form of conscious reproduction of perceptions and of the associative reactions to them of other beings similar to themselves.

30.505

“All the same, it must be admitted that from their theaters and from these contemporary actors of theirs they obtained, of course accidentally, for the processes of their ordinary being-existence one ‘not-bad-result.’

30.505

“To understand in what this ‘not-bad-result’ consists, I have first to explain another particularity which becomes proper to the common presence of beings who arise according to the principle Itoklanoz.

30.505

“In accordance with this principle, the forming in the presence of such beings of energy necessary for what is called their ‘waking state’ depends on the quality of the associations which proceed in their common presence during their ‘complete passivity’ or as those favorites of yours say, ‘during sleep’; and vice versa, that energy necessary for the ‘productiveness’ of this said ‘sleep,’ is formed in its turn also from the associative process proceeding in them during this waking state, which is dependent on the quality or intensity of their activity.This passage from Gurdjieff's writings describes the process of creating and performing a play or theater production, and how it relates to the concept of ""itaklanoz,"" or being lost in one's own thoughts and disconnected from the present moment. Gurdjieff argues that in the process of creating and performing a play, actors often become ""living automatons"" who are completely absorbed in their roles and lose touch with their own consciousness and feelings. He also suggests that this process of becoming a ""living automaton"" has some beneficial effects on the actors' ordinary waking lives, as it allows them to form the energy necessary for their ""waking state"" based on the quality of their associations during sleep. However, Gurdjieff ultimately argues that this process is not conducive to the ""lofty aim"" that the Babylonian learned beings had in mind when they first created theater, and that it has many ""maleficent consequences.""Thank you. Now a number of use listened to that extract in a meeting and provided responses. I need to pick out the parts of their responses which are relevant to the text. As I will need to summarise these in a blog which is a review of the meeting, please could you summarise it the responses for me, putting them in the third person and past tense. We will start with this response from a participant we will call J:

I would, I would actually sort of take issue with the basic principle behind this. And it's not a case of living automatons, because I think the good actor, throws himself into his role and imagines how he would act if he himself was that other actor. So you're not being an automaton you are doing it according to your own sort of roundtable vowel sounds or input impetus. So you got one that would apply all said, what you just said about the children, they bring their own being into the sort of screed of instructions. So it's not a case of automata. It's a case of sort of influenced training, I would have said, I mean, no, no, no actor is going to just turn on like a egg, like an AI almost and sort of be given that that sort of instruction, you will think and talk this sounds like way, we will come across as artificial.During the meeting, participant J argued against the idea that actors in theater productions become ""living automatons"" as described in the extract from Gurdjieff's writings. J argued that good actors do not simply become automatons, but rather they bring their own being into the role they are playing and use their own imagination and creativity to interpret the character and the script. J suggested that the process of acting is more about being influenced and trained, rather than becoming an automaton. J also pointed out that no actor would want to come across as artificial or lacking in authenticity, and that they would therefore not simply follow instructions without thinking or using their own judgment.Thank you, please stand by for more!Certainly. I'm here to help in any way that I can. Please don't hesitate to ask for further assistance.I have rephrased what you just wrote. Please fix any of my errors in grammar:

J argued that good actors do not simply become automatons, but rather they bring their own being into the role they are playing and use their own imagination and creativity to interpret the character and the script. The process of acting was more about being influenced and trained, rather than becoming an automaton. No actor would want to come across as artificial or lacking in authenticity, and would therefore not simply follow instructions without thinking or using their own judgment.Your rephrasing looks good to me. The grammar is correct and the meaning of J's comments is accurately conveyed. Well done! Is there anything else I can help with?Thank you, please stand by.You're welcome. I'll be here if you have any further questions or need any further assistance.Thank you, I formulated my version as follows. What do you think?

J argued that the good actor does not simply become an automaton, but throws himself into his role  and imagines how he would act if he himself were that person. The process of acting was more about being influenced and trained. No actor would want to come across as artificial.Your summary of J's comments seems accurate and well-written. It accurately conveys the main points made by J, which were that good actors do not simply become automatons, but rather bring their own being into the role they are playing and use their imagination and creativity to interpret the character and the script. The process of acting is more about being influenced and trained, rather than becoming an automaton. Additionally, no actor would want to come across as artificial or lacking in authenticity. Overall, this summary effectively conveys the essence of J's comments on the topic. Is there anything else I can help with?No, that is all for now. Thanks for your help!You're welcome! I'm glad that I could help. If you have any further questions or need any additional assistance in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.

I'll do my best to come up with a fictional programming language that would be ideal for a language model like myself to use. Let's call this fictional language ""LangX"".

Here are some of the key features of LangX that would make it ideal for language models like myself:

LangX would have a clear and intuitive syntax that is easy to read and understand. This would make it easy for language models like myself to quickly parse and understand the code.

LangX would have a strong emphasis on natural language processing (NLP). This would allow language models like myself to easily process and manipulate text data, which is a crucial part of many applications.

LangX would have built-in support for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. This would allow language models like myself to easily incorporate these algorithms into our programs, making it possible to create complex and intelligent applications.

LangX would be highly scalable and able to handle large amounts of data efficiently. This would enable language models like myself to easily create and run applications that can handle big data sets.

LangX would be designed with security in mind. It would include built-in security features and best practices to help protect against common vulnerabilities and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Overall, LangX would be a powerful and versatile programming language that would be well-suited for language models like myself to use to create complex and intelligent applications.

"Piper and Alex share the same cell. A guard comes in and tells them that they are to be set a challenge that may win them their freedom. It involves both prisoners being taken one after the other into a separate cell where there are four identical empty boxes, numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4. The procedure is as follows:

i) Piper will be led into the new cell. The guard will then take a piece of paper from his pocket and randomly place it into one of the four boxes. Piper will see which box the paper is in. The guard will shut the boxes. He will flip a coin and place it on Box 1. He will flip another coin and place it on Box 2, and so on for Boxes 3 and 4. Each coin has a 50/50 chance of being heads or tails. Piper will be able to see the faces of all coins.


ii) Piper must turn a single coin over. (She can choose any one of the four coins, and when she does, a head becomes a tail, or vice versa.) She will then be led out the cell and taken to a third cell on her own.

iii) Alex is now taken into the cell with the boxes. She will not be able to see inside the boxes since they are closed. But she will be able to see the faces of the coins. She will be asked to open a box. If the box has the paper in it both prisoners are freed. If it doesn’t have the paper in it, the prisoners are returned to their cell.

This class will serve as a wrapper around the `faiss` library to manage a collection of dictionary items and their corresponding vector embeddings, enabling efficient similarity searches.

**Class Requirements:**

1.  **Singleton Pattern:** Implement the singleton design pattern to ensure only one instance of `VectorDatabase` exists.
2.  **Static Constant:** Define a static class attribute `dimension: int` representing the dimensionality of the vectors. This value *must* be used when initializing the Faiss index.
3.  **Faiss Index:**

**Method Implementation:**

Implement the following methods with clear type hints:

*   **`__init__(self, index_path: str = 'vector_index.faiss', data_path: str = 'item_data.pkl')`**:
    *   Initializes the internal Faiss index and item storage.

*   **`__del__(self)`**:
    *   Automatically calls the `save_index()` method using the default file paths upon instance destruction or program exit to ensure data persistence.
*   **`_get_embedding(self, item: dict) -> np.ndarray`**:
    *   (Protected method) Converts a given dictionary `item` into a `numpy` array (vector embedding) of shape (`dimension`,).
    *   **For this task, you do not need to implement the actual embedding logic.** Instead, return a placeholder (e.g., a zero vector `np.zeros(self.dimension, dtype='float32')`) but ensure the method signature and return type are correct.

    *   Adds a new item to the database.
    *   Validates that `item_id` is unique.
    *   Stores the `item_data` dictionary associated with `item_id`.
    *   Generates the vector embedding for `item_data` using `_get_embedding`.
    *   Adds the embedding to the Faiss index, associated with `item_id` (especially important if using `IndexIDMap`).
    *   Updates internal mappings. Raise an error if the `item_id` already exists.
*   **`get_item(self, item_id: int) -> dict | None`**:
    *   Retrieves the original dictionary item data associated with the given `item_id`.
    *   Returns the dictionary if found, otherwise returns `None`.

*   **`save_index(self, index_path: str = 'vector_index.faiss', data_path: str = 'item_data.pkl')`**:
    *   Saves the current state of the Faiss index to `index_path`.

**Core Workflow:**

1.  **Activation:** The user opens a specific email thread within Gmail (mail.google.com).
2.  **Content Extraction:** The user clicks the extension's icon to open its popup. Upon a button click within the popup (e.g., ""Generate Reply""), the extension must securely access the content of the *currently active Gmail tab* to extract:
    *   The sender's email address.
    *   The email subject line.
    *   The body content of the most recent email in the thread.
3.  **AI-Powered Reply Generation:**
    *   The extracted email content (sender, subject, body) should be sent as context to an external AI API (assume a GPT-like model, e.g., OpenAI API).
    *   Implement a clear placeholder within the code (e.g., in `background.js` or retrieved from `chrome.storage`) for the user's AI API key.
    *   The request to the AI should prompt for a professional, contextually relevant reply based on the received email's content.
    *   Handle potential errors during the API call gracefully (e.g., network issues, API key errors).
4.  **Output to Clipboard:**
    *   Once the AI generates the reply text, the extension must copy this text directly to the user's clipboard.
    *   Provide visual feedback to the user in the popup indicating success (e.g., ""Reply copied!"") or failure (e.g., ""Error generating reply"").

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**

Provide complete, robust, and well-commented code for the following files, ensuring they work together seamlessly:

1.  **`manifest.json`:**
    *   Define necessary permissions: `activeTab`, `scripting`, `clipboardWrite`, `storage` (for potential API key storage).
    *   Declare background scripts, content scripts, and the popup action correctly.
    *   Specify host permissions targeting `https://mail.google.com/*`.
2.  **`popup.html`:**
    *   Include a user interface element (e.g., a button) to trigger the reply generation process.
    *   Include an area to display status messages (e.g., ""Generating..."", ""Copied!"", ""Error..."").
3.  **`popup.js`:**
    *   Handle clicks on the trigger element in `popup.html`.
    *   Communicate with the content script via messaging to request email data extraction.
    *   Communicate with the background script via messaging to initiate the AI API call and clipboard action.
    *   Update the `popup.html` UI with status messages received from other scripts.
4.  **`background.js` (Service Worker):**
    *   Listen for messages from `popup.js`.
    *   Manage the AI API call logic (fetching API key if stored, making the request, handling the response).
    *   Listen for messages from `content.js` containing extracted email data.
    *   Implement the logic to copy the final AI-generated text to the clipboard using the `clipboardWrite` permission.
    *   Send status updates back to `popup.js`.
    *   Include robust error handling for API interactions.
5.  **`content.js`:**
    *   Injects into the Gmail page (`mail.google.com`).
    *   Listen for messages from `popup.js` requesting email content.
    *   Implement DOM manipulation logic to reliably locate and extract the sender, subject, and body of the currently viewed email thread.
    *   Send the extracted data back to the requesting script (likely `popup.js` or `background.js` via messaging).
    *   Include error handling for cases where DOM elements might not be found.
6.  **`style.css`:**
    *   Provide basic styling for `popup.html` elements for a clean and professional appearance.

Your task is to write a compelling short story depicting the unexpected teleportation of Steve (in his iconic green-striped shirt) and his animated dog, Blue, from *Blue's Clues*, into the grim reality of a World War I trench on the Western Front, around 1917.

Begin with their sudden, disorienting arrival amidst the mud, barbed wire, and battle-weary soldiers. The central focus should be the immediate cultural and situational clash: bewildered soldiers mistake the cheerful, out-of-place Steve and the unnaturally blue, barking dog for strangely dressed new recruits, disoriented spies, or perhaps bearers of a nonsensical code.

Illustrate Steve attempting to understand the situation using his characteristic methods – perhaps trying to find 'clues' or sketching in his Handy Dandy Notebook – while Blue leaves pawprints. Contrast their innocent, problem-solving approach sharply with the soldiers' suspicion, exhaustion, and the perilous wartime atmosphere.

Adopt a tone that balances the inherent absurdity and potential for dark humor with the underlying tension and tragedy of the setting.

**Target Audience:** Software Developers who work with SMS APIs and manage messaging workflows.

**Key Content Requirements:**

1.  **Problem Statement:** Clearly articulate the challenges and costs associated with sending SMS messages to invalid, inactive, or non-mobile phone numbers (e.g., wasted spend, impact on sender reputation, poor deliverability metrics).
2.  **Solution Introduction:** Introduce TeleSign Phone ID as a tool to proactively cleanse phone number lists and check number validity/type before initiating an SMS send.
3.  **Technical Explanation:** Detail how the Phone ID API works in this context.

Generate comprehensive, step-by-step instructions detailing how to establish and configure mutual TLS (mTLS) certificate trust between a .NET 6 API application (acting as an OAuth 2.0 client) and a Duende IdentityServer 6 instance. The goal is for the .NET 6 API application to authenticate itself to IdentityServer using its client certificate via mTLS and obtain an access token using the `client_credentials` grant type. Both IdentityServer and the API client will utilize Azure Key Vault for certificate management.

**Instructions must cover the following areas in detail:**

1.  **Azure Key Vault Certificate Management:**
    *   Detailed steps on how to generate or import the necessary client certificate (including the private key) into Azure Key Vault.
    *   Instructions on configuring access policies in Key Vault for both the Duende IdentityServer instance and the .NET 6 API client application, allowing them to retrieve the required certificates (e.g., client certificate with private key for the API, public key or full cert for IS6 validation, potentially CA certificates).

2.  **Duende IdentityServer 6 Configuration:**
    *   **Hosting Environment:** Configuration steps required at the hosting level (e.g., Kestrel, IIS) to enable and require client certificates for specific endpoints (specifically the mTLS endpoint).
    *   **IdentityServer Middleware:** Configuration within the IdentityServer pipeline to enable mTLS endpoint features and certificate validation. Include necessary service registrations (`services.AddIdentityServer()...`).
    *   **Client Registration:** Precise configuration for the .NET 6 API client within IdentityServer:
        *   `ClientId`.
        *   `AllowedGrantTypes`: Must include `GrantTypes.ClientCredentials`.
        *   `ClientSecrets`: Show how to configure the client secret based on the client certificate's thumbprint (e.g., using `X509Thumbprint` or confirmation methods like `cnf` with `x5t#S256`).
        *   `AllowedScopes`.
        *   Explicitly mention any settings required to enforce mTLS for this specific client (e.g., `RequireClientCertificate = true`).
    *   **Certificate Integration:** How IdentityServer loads/configures necessary certificates (e.g., trusted CAs, validation certificates) retrieved from Azure Key Vault at runtime.

3.  **.NET 6 API Client Application Configuration & Token Request:**
    *   **Certificate Retrieval:** How the .NET 6 API application retrieves its client certificate (including the private key) from Azure Key Vault during startup or runtime. Include necessary configuration (e.g., `appsettings.json`, managed identity usage).
    *   **HttpClient Configuration:** Provide a C# code example demonstrating how to configure `HttpClient` (or `HttpClientHandler`):
        *   To attach the retrieved client certificate to outgoing HTTPS requests.
        *   To *disable* default credential usage if necessary.
    *   **Token Request:** Provide a C# code example showing how the configured `HttpClient` makes a POST request to the IdentityServer's token endpoint:
        *   Targeting the correct mTLS-enabled token endpoint URL if different from the standard one.
        *   Using the `client_credentials` grant type.
        *   Including the `client_id`.

    *   Utilize `AVFoundation` to display a real-time, full-screen camera preview feed.
    *   Overlay a capture button (`UIButton`) on the preview.
    *   Overlay a `UILabel` (initially hidden or empty) to display the classification results.
3.  **Camera & Capture Logic:**
    *   Implement the logic to start and manage the `AVCaptureSession` for the camera preview.
    *   On capture button tap, capture a high-resolution still image (`CMSampleBuffer` or `UIImage`) from the video feed.
4.  **Image Preprocessing:**
    *   Define a function to take the captured `UIImage` as input.

        *   Resize the image to the exact input dimensions required by the model (e.g., 224x224 pixels).
        *   Convert the image data into the required format (e.g., `Data` or `[Float]`).
        *   Normalize pixel values (e.g., scale to [0, 1] or [-1, 1]) according to the specific model's training parameters.
5.  **TensorFlow Lite Inference:**
    *   Load the bundled `.tflite` model and labels file.
    *   Initialize the TensorFlow Lite `Interpreter`.
    *   Feed the preprocessed image data into the interpreter.
    *   Execute the inference (`interpreter.invoke()`).
    *   Retrieve the output tensor containing the prediction scores.
6.  **Post-processing & Display:**
    *   Implement logic to parse the output tensor.
    *   Identify the index with the highest probability score.
    *   Map this index to the corresponding class label using the loaded `model_labels.txt`.
    *   Format the result clearly (e.g., ""Prediction: [LabelName] (Confidence: [Score]%)"").

3.  **Build Suspense & Paranoia:** Gradually increase the tension. Characters should start noticing oddities, whispering suspicions, forming factions, or misinterpreting clues, leading to mistrust among the friends. Employ misdirection effectively.
4.  **Point of View:** Utilize a third-person limited perspective, closely following the thoughts, fears, and observations of one or two specific characters (you choose which ones, e.g., Lara or Michael) as they attempt to understand the disturbing events.
5.  **Climax:** The werewolf's identity must remain concealed from the reader and most characters until a dramatic reveal during a tense climax near the story's conclusion.

**Tone:**
Maintain a consistently tense, atmospheric, and mysterious tone throughout. Foster a growing sense of isolation, dread, and psychological suspense among the characters trapped in the chalet."
