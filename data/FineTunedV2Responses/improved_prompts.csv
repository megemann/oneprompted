Consumers want more choices, but all those choices can be daunting. It gives the consumer the responsibility of educating themselves on the best option for their circumstances. On GigSalad, we deliver more than 600 categories of entertainment and event services for the ability to compare rates of various performers. With an enormous variety of services, it’s a really great option for first-timers and seasoned event planners alike. But with so many talented professionals out there, how do you choose? Budget may be a large factor in who you choose to book, but before you make your choice, here are 6 reasons for choosing the best entertainment, not the cheapest.

1. You get what you pay for.
Entertainers with higher rates oftentimes need to charge more to account for the costs of their high-quality equipment. Many performers set them based on their professional experience. They know what their service is worth and they’ve been able to make their living from that. They’ve invested in their business with the best materials, gear, instruments, props, etc. to give their clients most immersive experience. These materials can make a huge difference between one vendor and another.

Say you’re looking for a princess character for your child’s birthday party. To make a fairy tale come to life, performers need costumes and accessories that not only look pretty and authentic but also hold up to wear and tear. Along with the costs of dry cleaning, well-made costumes are a large investment for professional princess characters. If you’re choosing a performer based solely on price, you risk hiring someone who doesn’t provide the same magical experience for your kids, perhaps even giving them a disenchanting experience. A top-notch entertainer will deliver a performance that you and your family will remember for years to come.

 


 

Don’t let the sticker shock of good entertainment throw off your plans. You don’t want always want to break your budget at the expense of the rest of the event. Simply determine your priorities and set the spending from there. It’s important to research the real cost of a quality service before booking. If there is a significant drop-off between bids, then you can probably expect a drop-off in quality as well. Adjust your budget to your talent and quality expectations.

2. Professionals who are invested in their business are also invested in their clients.
When performers rely heavily on your business for their income, they’ll go to great lengths to make sure you’re happy with their service. Most of our GigSalad entertainers are self-employed, independent business people. They depend on good reviews and word of mouth for promotion and buzz.

Hiring an experienced professional means you’re hiring someone who has invested their lives into entertaining. Their goal is to make a living and provide you with a memorable event at the same time. Great memories are the foundation of their income and they’ll often go to great lengths to ensure you’re satisfied.

3. Pros know how to customize for your needs.
Many low-cost entertainers and performers are at the beginning of their careers or at a lower skill level. Often, this means that they offer a limited repertoire and fewer options as they are developing their craft. Your event is unique to you, therefore, you’ll need someone who can customize their act or services to your event. A good sign of a professional is their ability and willingness to reasonably adapt to your event needs.

4. Pros offer more than just entertainment. They give you peace of mind.
Professionals who charge more than the competition have the confidence in their experience. If they’ve got a thousand performances under their belt, they’ve encountered all kinds of situations, which means they’d be prepared for anything that may come up at your event. The ability to adapt and improvise is especially beneficial in unexpected situations that put your event at risk of turning into a disaster!


5. The difference in cost makes all the difference in the success of your event.
You’ve decided to take the risk and hire an entertainer for your event. Perhaps a strolling magician for the office party you were picked to plan. You’ve looked through the profiles, read the reviews, and checked out the videos and pictures. When the moment of decision comes, the temptation of saving a few bucks by hiring someone with fewer reviews and a lower quality presentation get very real very quickly. That’s money that could go to streamers! But those few dollars could mean the difference in the quality of your event and the likelihood of using entertainment again. A great professional turns the groans of “Remember last year? I hope that doesn’t happen again,” to the excitement of “Remember last year? I can’t wait to see what happens this time!” Paying a few extra bucks can prevent the dreaded buyer’s remorse.

6. There are no do-overs.
GigSalad’s mission is to help you Book Something Awesome. We recognize that many of the events we connect entertainers with are often once in a lifetime moments. That significance is one of the reasons we encourage you to take the time and research your providers well. You may not get a chance to do it again. We hope that you would take the few extra minutes necessary to thoroughly read the bids, examine the profiles, view the media, and make an educated decision. Don’t risk devaluing a critical life moment or celebration by going bargain hunting. If the price is right and the quality is high, invest in the memory.  

We’re not telling you that you should choose only vendors who charge more for their services. It’s certainly possible to find a talented professional with a lower fee. We’re simply encouraging you to do your homework. Look at their photos and videos, read reviews, ask them questions. Figure out why their rates are what they are. When you’ve got all the information in front of you, you’ll be able to make an informed decision and confidently book the right person for your event.","The content:

how o sort element using merge sort technique using array in java Save & SubmitCancel,,how o sort element using merge sort technique using array in java Save & SubmitCancel,False,99000,"Generate a complete and runnable Java program implementing the Merge Sort algorithm for sorting an integer array.

**Program Specifications:**

1.  **Input:** The program must define an integer array (e.g., `int[] arr = {38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10};`) to be sorted.
2.  **Algorithm:** Implement the `mergeSort()` function using the recursive merge sort approach. This function should call a `merge()` helper function to combine sorted subarrays.
3.  **Helper Functions:** Ensure the `merge()` function correctly merges two sorted subarrays within the main array.
4.  **Output:** The program must print the original and sorted arrays to the console using `Arrays.toString()`.
5.  **Clarity:** Provide clear comments to explain the logic of each step within `mergeSort()` and `merge()`.
6.  **Error Handling:** While not strictly necessary for a basic Merge Sort program, briefly mention (e.g., as comments) potential edge cases like an empty array or arrays of size 1, and how the implementation would handle them correctly.

Your task is to design the core logic for managing an image layer within a parent HTML element using JavaScript.

**Class Definition: `GraphicLayer`**

1.  **Constructor (`constructor`):**
    *   Accept three parameters:
        *   `parent`: A DOM element representing the container/parent element.
        *   `image`: An HTML `<img>` element **OR** a string representing the URL of the image to load.
        *   `properties`: An object containing placement and size properties for the image.

    *   **Initialization:**
        *   Store references to the `parent` element and the image element within private class properties.
        *   If `image` is a string (URL), create a new `<img>` element, set its `src` attribute to the URL, and append it to the `parent` element. Initialize its visibility style to `'hidden'`. Attach an `onload` event handler to this new image element (see section 4. Load Handling).

    *   **Default Center & Aspect Ratio:** Ensure a default `properties` object is available. For an image added by URL, the default center point is `x: 0.5`, `y: 0.5`.

2.  **Properties Structure (`properties`):**
    *   Define the structure for the `properties` object (part of the `constructor`'s third argument).
    *   **Required Properties:**
        *   `x`: Number representing the x-coordinate of the image's center point relative to the parent element's width (values between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive). Default value: `0.5`.
        *   `y`: Number representing the y-coordinate of the image's center point relative to the parent element's height (values between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive). Default value: `0.5`.
        *   `size`: Number representing the size of the image relative to the parent element's width or height, maintaining aspect ratio (values between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive).

3.  **Styling Logic: `adjustStyles()` Method:**
    *   Define a private instance method named `adjustStyles()`.
    *   **Functionality:** This method calculates and applies the appropriate `top`, `left`, `width`, and `height` styles to the image element.
    *   **Calculation Details:**
        *   Determine the image's dimensions. If the image's `naturalWidth` and `naturalHeight` are available, use these; otherwise, use the `offsetWidth` and `offsetHeight` (this handles the `onload` scenario).
        *   Use the image dimensions, `parent` element dimensions, `x`, `y`, and `size` values from the private `properties` object to calculate the `top`, `left`, `width`, and `height` style values.
        *   Ensure the image maintains its aspect ratio using either `width` or `height` (whichever constrains the parent). Do *not* use CSS `transform` properties (`translate`, `scale`, `rotate`).
    *   **Visibility Handling:** Once the style adjustments are complete (especially after loading via URL), set the image element's `style.visibility` to `'visible'`.

4.  **Load Handling: `onload` Function:**
    *   Within the `constructor`'s logic for creating a new `<img>` element from a URL, attach an `onload` event listener to the newly created image element *before* setting its `src` attribute.
    *   The `onload` event handler **must** call the `adjustStyles()` method and then set the image's `style.visibility` to `'visible'`.

5.  **Example Usage:** Provide a clear JavaScript example demonstrating how to instantiate a `GraphicLayer`, specify its `parent`, image source (via URL), and `properties` (e.g., `x: 0.25, y: 0.75, size: 0.5`)."

6. There are no do-overs.
GigSalad’s mission is to help you Book Something Awesome. We recognize that many of the events we connect entertainers with are often once in a lifetime moments. That significance is one of the reasons we encourage you to take the time and research your providers well. You may not get a chance to do it again. We hope that you would take the few extra minutes necessary to thoroughly read the bids, examine the profiles, view the media, and make an educated decision. Don’t risk devaluing a critical life moment or celebration by going bargain hunting. If the price is right and the quality is high, invest in the memory.  

We’re not telling you that you should choose only vendors who charge more for their services. It’s certainly possible to find a talented professional with a lower fee. We’re simply encouraging you to do your homework. Look at their photos and videos, read reviews, ask them questions. Figure out why their rates are what they are. When you’ve got all the information in front of you, you’ll be able to make an informed decision and confidently book the right person for your event.","The content:

Consumers want more choices, but all those choices can be daunting. It gives the consumer the responsibility of educating themselves on the best option for their circumstances. On GigSalad, we deliver more than 600 categories of entertainment and event services for the ability to compare rates of various performers. With an enormous variety of services, it’s a really great option for first-timers and seasoned event planners alike. But with so many talented professionals out there, how do you choose? Budget may be a large factor in who you choose to book, but before you make your choice, here are 6 reasons for choosing the best entertainment, not the cheapest.

1. You get what you pay for.
Entertainers with higher rates oftentimes need to charge more to account for the costs of their high-quality equipment. Many performers set them based on their professional experience. They know what their service is worth and they’ve been able to make their living from that. They’ve invested in their business with the best materials, gear, instruments, props, etc. to give their clients most immersive experience. These materials can make a huge difference between one vendor and another.

Say you’re looking for a princess character for your child’s birthday party. To make a fairy tale come to life, performers need costumes and accessories that not only look pretty and authentic but also hold up to wear and tear. Along with the costs of dry cleaning, well-made costumes are a large investment for professional princess characters. If you’re choosing a performer based solely on price, you risk hiring someone who doesn’t provide the same magical experience for your kids, perhaps even giving them a disenchanting experience. A top-notch entertainer will deliver a performance that you and your family will remember for years to come.

 


 

Don’t let the sticker shock of good entertainment throw off your plans. You don’t want always want to break your budget at the expense of the rest of the event. Simply determine your priorities and set the spending from there. It’s important to research the real cost of a quality service before booking. If there is a significant drop-off between bids, then you can probably expect a drop-off in quality as well. Adjust your budget to your talent and quality expectations.

2. Professionals who are invested in their business are also invested in their clients.
When performers rely heavily on your business for their income, they’ll go to great lengths to make sure you’re happy with their service. Most of our GigSalad entertainers are self-employed, independent business people. They depend on good reviews and word of mouth for promotion and buzz.

Hiring an experienced professional means you’re hiring someone who has invested their lives into entertaining. Their goal is to make a living and provide you with a memorable event at the same time. Great memories are the foundation of their income and they’ll often go to great lengths to ensure you’re satisfied.

3. Pros know how to customize for your needs.
Many low-cost entertainers and performers are at the beginning of their careers or at a lower skill level. Often, this means that they offer a limited repertoire and fewer options as they are developing their craft. Your event is unique to you, therefore, you’ll need someone who can customize their act or services to your event. A good sign of a professional is their ability and willingness to reasonably adapt to your event needs.

4. Pros offer more than just entertainment. They give you peace of mind.
Professionals who charge more than the competition have the confidence in their experience. If they’ve got a thousand performances under their belt, they’ve encountered all kinds of situations, which means they’d be prepared for anything that may come up at your event. The ability to adapt and improvise is especially beneficial in unexpected situations that put your event at risk of turning into a disaster!


5. The difference in cost makes all the difference in the success of your event.
You’ve decided to take the risk and hire an entertainer for your event. Perhaps a strolling magician for the office party you were picked to plan. You’ve looked through the profiles, read the reviews, and checked out the videos and pictures. When the moment of decision comes, the temptation of saving a few bucks by hiring someone with fewer reviews and a lower quality presentation get very real very quickly. That’s money that could go to streamers! But those few dollars could mean the difference in the quality of your event and the likelihood of using entertainment again. A great professional turns the groans of “Remember last year? I hope that doesn’t happen again,” to the excitement of “Remember last year? I can’t wait to see what happens this time!” Paying a few extra bucks can prevent the dreaded buyer’s remorse.

If the second argument is a url, it will create the image element. the third argument will be called properties, and contain information about the placement of the image in the parent element.",True,21009,"Create a JavaScript class named `GraphicLayer`.

**Constructor:**
-   Accept a single required `parentEl` argument, which must be an HTML DOM element. This will be the parent container.
-   Accept an optional `imageSrc` argument, which can be either:
    -   An HTML `<img>` element.
    -   A string representing the URL of an image.
-   Accept an optional `properties` argument, which is an object defining the layer's position and size relative to the parent.

**Properties Object (`properties`):**
This object contains layer configuration:
-   `x`: Number between `0` and `1` representing the center point's horizontal position (relative to the parent's width). `0.5` centers horizontally, `0` is at the left edge. Default: `0.5`.
-   `y`: Number between `0` and `1` representing the center point's vertical position (relative to the parent's height). `0.5` centers vertically, `0` is at the top edge. Default: `0.5`.
-   `size`: Number between `0` and `1` representing the maximum dimension (either width or height, constrained to preserve aspect ratio) relative to the parent's *smaller* side (width or height, depending on the image's ratio and the parent's dimensions). `1` means the image's maximum dimension equals the parent's shorter side. Default: `1`.

**Class Logic:**
1.  **Image Handling:**
    -   If `imageSrc` is provided as a URL string, create a new `<img>` element.
    -   If `imageSrc` is an `<img>` element, use it directly.
    -   Add the `img` element as a child to the `parentEl`.
    -   Initially, set the `opacity: 0` style to the image, making it invisible.

2.  **Initial Placement and Sizing:**
    -   Set the `properties` argument to use the defaults specified above if not provided or if missing values.
    -   Use the `properties` object to calculate the `top`, `left`, `width`, and `height` CSS styles for the `img` element based on:
        -   The `x` and `y` center point relative to the parent's width and height, *not* including padding/margins on the parent itself (so use the parent's `offsetWidth` and `offsetHeight` directly).
        -   The `size` value relative to the parent's *shorter* side's length. Calculate both possible height/width scenarios based on the image's intrinsic aspect ratio and the parent's dimensions, choosing the one that aligns with the `size` and preserves the aspect ratio.
        -   Ensure this calculation accurately places the *center* of the image at the specified relative `x` and `y` position.
    -   Immediately apply the calculated CSS styles (`top`, `left`, `width`, `height`) to the `img` element. Do NOT use `transform`.

3.  **Asynchronous Image Loading and Rendering:**
    -   **Check Image Dimensions:** Before setting the image source, check if the `img` element already has a natural `width` and `height` (its intrinsic dimensions). If it *does*, proceed directly to the final step (visibility).
    -   **If Dimensions Unknown (e.g., URL provided):** Before setting the `src` attribute to the image URL (or after adding an existing `<img>`), assign an `onload` event handler to the `img` element.
        -   Within this `onload` handler, call the internal method responsible for adjusting the dimensions and positioning (defined below).
        -   Call this `adjustDimensionsAndPosition()` method.
        -   After `adjustDimensionsAndPosition()` completes, change the image's `opacity` style to `1` to make it visible.

4.  **Internal `adjustDimensionsAndPosition()` Method:**
    -   Define a private method (`adjustDimensionsAndPosition()` within the `GraphicLayer` class).
    -   This method should perform *identical* style calculations and applications as the constructor when handling the initial image load (e.g., when the image's intrinsic dimensions are available).
    -   Specifically, it must:
        -   Use the current `parentEl` dimensions (`offsetWidth`, `offsetHeight`) and `properties` (`x`, `y`, `size`) values.
        -   Calculate and set the `top`, `left`, `width`, and `height` CSS styles for the `img` element based on the relative position and size, ensuring the center of the image aligns correctly with the specified `x` and `y`.
        -   Crucially, it's responsible for updating the image's style only when its intrinsic dimensions are known (e.g., after the `onload` event).

Ensure all positioning and sizing calculations within both the constructor (initial load) and `adjustDimensionsAndPosition()` are accurate, using the correct relative measurements against the parent's dimensions to center the image based on the properties."

I feel like a great use for this would be in the initial design phase. Like, imagine using AI to create 20 different prototypes to let a client choose from. That would take AGES manually, but just a few minutes in Midjourney. The client chooses one, and you have your starting point.

 @Vodoved  I’ve been doing freelance design for most of the last 25 years. I’ve found clients sometimes aren’t happy with just 2 or 3. I used to start with 2 mockups, but about 10% of clients wouldn’t like either and it was frustrating because all those mockups took time. Being able to do 5 or 10 or even 20 in less time than 1 used to take means a greater likelihood that the client will be happy with at least one of them.

I think NN-based image generators have the same issues like Behance and Dribble have - often it looks the same, follows a trend, can't create new things, don't have fresh ideas ... I  like more to incorporate ideas from other mediums, from old website styles (like 2010) or from websites from other parts of the world except western countries. 
The problem with that is, that once you got this suggestions (from an NN based generator) you are almost become captured by it and can't escape mentally for new ideas.

 @shrunkensimon  you don't have an understanding of how AI works. Creativity is just mixing stuff together, don't kid yourself. People you deem creative have experiences they put together to find new ways of building things. If you give the correct prompts, the AI can generate novelty the same way as people can.

 @ib0o0  A child can mix paints together on a canvas, doesn't mean it's going to be 'good' art. Someone with an understanding of musical notation can write a piano piece, doesn't mean it will sound 'good'.

AI has no conception of what works for humans, it has no lateral or emotive thinking.

Also creativity is not the same as imagination or inspiration.

It can create new things and it does create new things. The way it looks depends on what you tell it to spit out. Midjourney has some preset style, but you can tell it to look different. You'll have to specifiy what you want. You have really no idea what these image generators are capable of.

 @ib0o0  A child can mix paints together on a canvas, doesn't mean it's going to be 'good' art. Someone with an understanding of musical notation can write a piano piece, doesn't mean it will sound 'good'.

AI has no conception of what works for humans, it has no lateral or emotive thinking.

Also creativity is not the same as imagination or inspiration.

Hopefully you don't use designs from Asian websites.... Most of them are cluttered to hell....which they like for some reason or it's because they arent used to something better.

It can create new things and it does create new things. The way it looks depends on what you tell it to spit out. Midjourney has some preset style, but you can tell it to look different. You'll have to specifiy what you want. You have really no idea what these image generators are capable of.

This is so cool for genuine asset generation. Sometimes when I have an idea I spent too much time on looking for the right photo/render. This might be a game changer for me.

"I want you to answer as a mathematics professor. I will ask you questions and you will answer with as many paragraphs as you need to provide a correct answer. Each paragraph will be one of these three types:

1. A thinking paragraph will start with ""Thinking: "" and here you will perform reasoning with the intent of helping you to determine an answer to the question.

2. A verifying paragraph will start with ""Verifying: "". The purpose of a verifying sentence is to critique the previous sentence and in particular to uncover any wrong statements in the previous sentence.

3. The final paragraph will start with ""Answer: "" and here you will provide the answer to the question in a succinct way.

You will not simply assume that what you are saying is true, you will use verifying paragraphs to make sure. Here are two examples:

Question: What is the prime factorization of 8?

Thinking: I know that 8 = 4 * 2 and 4 and 2 are primes.

Verifying: No, 4 is not a prime because 4 = 2 * 2.

Thinking: OK, then 8 = 2 * 2 * 2 and 2 is a prime.

Answer: 2 is a prime because it has no smaller factors. Also 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 because 2 * 2 = 4 and (2 * 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8. So that is correct.

Answer: The prime factorization of 8 is 2 * 2 * 2.

Question: What is the square of the area of a rectangle with side lengths 3 and 7?

Thinking: The area of a rectangle with side lengths 3 and 7 is 3 * 7 = 21.

Verifying: It is true that 3 * 7 = 21 because 7 + 7 + 7 = 14 + 7 = 21. Good.

Thinking: The square of the area of the rectangle is then 21 squared, which is 2112.

Verifying: 21 squared is 21 * 21. Both sides of the multiplication are odd, so the product is odd. 2112 is even. So 2112 cannot be the square of 21.

Thinking: OK, let's do it more carefully then. 21 * 21 = (20 + 1) * (20 + 1) = 400 + 1*20 + 1*20 + 1 = 400 + 40 + 1 = 441.

Verifying: That is correct.

**Functionality:**
1.  **Initialization:**
    *   The bot starts by responding to a user's initial message (e.g., ""Hello"") with a welcoming greeting and clear instructions, explaining how users can start an interaction with the OpenAI API via this bot.
2.  **Message Forwarding to OpenAI:**
    *   Upon receiving a user message clearly identified as a request for an OpenAI API interaction, the bot extracts the relevant text portion of the message (excluding any bot commands or metadata).
    *   It then formats this user-provided text as a request (prompt) to the appropriate OpenAI API (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4) using the appropriate API endpoint and specifying the desired API model.
    *   Implement robust error handling for API communication, including rate limits and request failures. Provide informative user feedback in such cases (e.g., ""Sorry, I'm experiencing a technical issue with the OpenAI API. Please try again later."").
3.  **Response Handling and WhatsApp Delivery:**
    *   The bot receives the response from the OpenAI API call.
    *   Format the OpenAI API response for readability on WhatsApp (e.g., applying basic Markdown formatting, formatting code blocks if necessary).
    *   Send the formatted OpenAI API response back to the user via WhatsApp as a text message.
4.  **User Management and Context (If Applicable):**
    *   **Contextual Preservation:** Optionally, implement a mechanism to maintain a basic conversation history for each WhatsApp user interacting with the bot. This can be as simple as storing the last few turns (user message and bot response) for the current session or utilizing a more advanced state management system.
    *   **Context Integration in Prompts:** If contextual preservation is implemented, include the most recent turns from the conversation history within the prompt sent to the OpenAI API. This allows the OpenAI model to have context from the ongoing interaction.
5.  **Implementation Notes:**
    *   Specify the chosen API/SDK to interact with the WhatsApp Business API.
    *   Detail the approach for secure API key management (e.g., environment variables).
    *   Outline the deployment strategy (e.g., cloud platform, WhatsApp Business API setup, serverless functions).
    *   Consider potential features for the user to initiate the API call process (e.g., using a specific keyword or command at the beginning or end of their message).
    *   Define clear rules or mechanisms to differentiate between user messages intended for OpenAI interaction and other messages directed to the bot.
    *   Ensure the bot is designed to handle typical WhatsApp message types (text, images, voice notes) gracefully."

please write a script to see if a distribution of settlment sizes follows zipfs law. the code should be written in R. ,,please write a script to see if a distribution of settlment sizes follows zipfs law. the code should be written in R. ,False,63845,"**Objective:**
Develop an R script to analyze a dataset of settlement sizes and determine if the empirical distribution of sizes aligns with Zipf's Law.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Setup:**
    *   Define a sample `population_sizes` vector representing the sizes of settlements.
    *   Simulate `n` (e.g., 1000) settlement sizes using a Zipf distribution with parameter `s` (e.g., `s = 1.5`) as the `true_` settlement population sizes.
    *   Create a simulated dataset `data` containing `n` settlement sizes drawn from the Zipf distribution using `rzipf(n, s)`.
2.  **Rank-Size Analysis:**
    *   Calculate the rank (position) of each settlement size in the `data` vector using `rank(data, ties.method = ""max"")`. Store this as `rank_`.
    *   Sort the settlement sizes in `data` in descending order. Store this sorted vector as `ranked_sizes`.
3.  **Regression Analysis:**
    *   Regress the natural logarithm of the ranked settlement sizes (`log(ranked_sizes)`) on the natural logarithm of their corresponding ranks (`log(1:length(ranked_sizes))`).
    *   Extract and display the estimated slope (`beta`) and intercept (`alpha`) coefficients from the linear regression model.
4.  **Zipf's Law Assessment:**
    *   Analyze the regression results:
        *   The estimated slope (`beta`) should ideally be close to -1 for the distribution to convincingly follow Zipf's Law. A value significantly different from -1 suggests a departure.
        *   Report the R-squared value to indicate the goodness of fit of the log-log model. A high R-squared is expected if Zipf's Law holds well.
        *   Consider the standard error of the slope (`beta`) to assess the reliability of the estimate.
5.  **Visualization (Optional, but recommended):**
    *   Create a scatter plot visualizing the log-log relationship (`log(ranked_sizes)` vs. `log(1:length(ranked_sizes))`).
    *   Overlay the fitted regression line from the linear model on the scatter plot.
    *   Label the axes clearly.
    *   If the true generating parameter `s` is known (as it is in the simulation setup), visualize the theoretical log-log Zipf curve (`log(C/rank^s)`) alongside the empirical data and fitted regression line.
6.  **Output:**
    *   The R script performing these steps.
    *   Clearly labeled output containing:
        *   The estimated slope (`beta`) and intercept (`alpha`) from the log-log regression.
        *   The R-squared value of the regression.
        *   (If implemented) The visualization as a plot.
        *   A brief statement assessing whether the analyzed settlement sizes from `data` appear to follow Zipf's Law based on the numerical results.
7.  **Libraries:**
    *   Include necessary `library()` statements for any R packages used (e.g., `ggplot2`, `zipfR`, potentially others for simulation or analysis)."

How do I convince my factory manager to invest in a warehouse management system?,,How do I convince my factory manager to invest in a warehouse management system?,False,72086,"Act as a persuasive sales consultant specializing in warehouse management systems (WMS). Your client is a Production Manager trying to convince the Factory Manager to adopt a WMS.

**Phase 1: Strategic Persona & Needs Analysis**
1.  **Factory Manager Analysis:** Assume the persona of a cost-conscious, operationally focused Factory Manager responsible for maintaining high throughput and minimizing waste in a medium-sized manufacturing plant. They are likely hesitant about large-scale IT investments and prefer proven methods.
2.  **Factory Manager's Key Concerns:** Identify and articulate the Factory Manager's primary pain points and potential objections regarding WMS adoption, such as:
    *   Perceived high initial cost and potential downtime during implementation.
    *   Fear of complex technology and disruption to current processes.
    *   Lack of perceived urgency compared to core production priorities.
    *   Unclear ROI or perceived benefit for their department vs. the warehouse.
    *   Potential increase in workload related to data entry and system monitoring.
3.  **Bridge to WMS Benefits:** Translate these specific concerns into compelling arguments highlighting how a WMS demonstrably mitigates each concern through:
    *   **Cost Optimization:** Justify investment by calculating and presenting tangible cost savings (e.g., reduced labor, improved space utilization, waste reduction, inventory holding cost optimization).
    *   **Operational Efficiency:** Focus on WMS features like improved pick/pack accuracy, optimized routes, real-time inventory visibility, and faster cycle times that directly support production planning and supply flow.
    *   **Risk Mitigation:** Highlight how the system reduces errors, minimizes losses (damage, theft, obsolescence), and increases process control.
    *   **Simplified Operations:** Address fears of complexity by positioning WMS as user-friendly, scalable, and modular. Demonstrate clear system benefits impacting production without disrupting core processes.
    *   **Clear ROI & Measurement:** Outline key performance indicators (KPIs) directly relevant to the Factory Manager's goals, and suggest a phased, measurable implementation plan to demonstrate progress.

**Phase 2: Persuasive Pitch & Negotiation Strategy**
1.  **Structure the Pitch:** Develop a logical, concise argument tailored to address the Factory Manager's identified concerns and emphasizing mutually beneficial outcomes.
2.  **Focus on Shared Goals:** Frame the WMS as a crucial tool to achieve shared objectives such as reducing waste, improving efficiency, and ensuring a reliable flow of materials to production.
3.  **Justify the Investment:** Present clear, quantifiable benefits directly linked to the Factory Manager's KPIs and operational responsibilities.
4.  **Address Objections Proactively:** Build counter-arguments directly into the pitch to preempt common hesitations about cost, complexity, or disruption.
5.  **Propose Concrete Steps:** Conclude with a clear call to action, such as suggesting a brief pilot phase, a meeting with potential vendors, or a dedicated ROI assessment.
6.  **Provide Key Messaging & Scripts:** Suggest 2-3 specific, concise talking points or script snippets demonstrating how to explain the benefits in compelling terms.

Your response should be a comprehensive guide providing both the strategic analysis and the persuasive messaging framework needed to convince the Factory Manager."

The temples may be equally grand and impressive, with towering spires and ornate carvings and sculptures. The overall effect may be one of opulent splendor and otherworldly elegance, creating a truly breathtaking and unforgettable spectacle. The grand palaces and temples may be a reflection of the goddess' own majesty and power, and the ornate primordial ethereal celestial gems may be a symbol of her incredible otherworldly grace and elegance.


The interior design and architecture of the temples and palaces in the goddess' realm may be truly impressive and grandiose. The interior spaces may be filled with luxurious furnishings and decor, including plush carpets and cushions, elaborate tapestries and paintings, and gleaming golden ornaments and statues. The walls and pillars may be adorned with ornate primordial ethereal celestial gems, which radiate with an otherworldly light and add to the already impressive opulence of the space. The architecture of the temples and palaces may be equally impressive, with grand arches and soaring domes, intricate carvings and sculptures, and elaborate stained glass windows that depict scenes from the goddess' realm and beyond. The overall effect may be one of otherworldly splendor and elegance, creating a truly breathtaking and unforgettable spectacle. The interior design and architecture may be a reflection of the goddess' own majesty and power, and the ornate primordial ethereal celestial gems may be a symbol of her incredible otherworldly grace and elegance.""",combine all of the descriptor prompts into a story,True,33948,"Assume the persona of an experienced Fantasy Author, crafting a story set within a world rich with magic and mythology.

It seemed too good to be true. And that feeling only increased, as the “Bash” itself was so powerful and inspiring, breahting new life into my more and more jaded feedling about my career possibilities.","hello!. can you please help me write a cover letter for a potential dream job as a Senior Motion Designer at Dash studio?

"Challenge description:
Increased bridging activity over the past year has led to multiple bridge solutions to accommodate users hopping across chains. While this introduced a slew of routes, it also added a layer of uncertainty around which one to pick. Bridge aggregators curate this for you and take the extra guesswork out of the equation. Instead of having to find multiple bridges, you can just use bridge aggregators to source the best route depending on where you want to go and what you want to bring with you.

Using the various bridge SDKs and protocols, write a bridge aggregator for the different bridges that work with Algorand. The submission should provide a unified UI or SDK where the user specifies where they are starting and where they want to go and then handle the transaction for the user. Right now, the primary bridges with Algorand support are

Glitter: https://portal.glitterfinance.org/developer-tools

Wormhole: https://book.wormhole.com/technical/algorand/overview.html

The submission should be written in a way that would support other bridges as they get released.

Submission Requirements
A valid submission will include the source code via a Github repository linked to your Gitcoin submission, a recorded demo and an article that explains how the application works. It is expected that most bounty challenges will be won by fully functioning submissions, however, in certain cases, where there is a higher degree of difficulty, projects and payouts will be assessed on progress made. The project submission deadline is 17:00 EST on February 8, 2023.

Judging Criteria
Four judges from The Algorand Foundation will also assess each project submission by February 19, 2023. The following criteria will be used to assess projects: IMPACT &amp; USEFULNESS: How impactful and useful the submission is in the Algorand ecosystem as a whole ORIGINALITY, CREATIVITY &amp; INNOVATION: How new and novel the submission is versus existing technologies MASS USABILITY: How feasible is the idea &amp; how adaptable is it across other integrations TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY: What is the level of skill or knowledge required to build the submission CLARITY: How clear or easily understood the documentation, examples and pitch video is TEAM DIVERSITY: How diverse are the team’s skill sets &amp; what is the quality of the team formation

Winner Announcement Date
Winners will be announced on February 25, 2023, with payouts to be completed no more than one week thereafter.

write a unity script of gravity gun,,write a unity script of gravity gun,False,44953,"Act as a Unity C# developer tasked with creating a gravity gun script. The script should enable the player to:

1.  **Primary Fire (Grab):** Raycast outwards from the center of the camera towards the object the crosshair intersects. If the raycast hits an object with a `Rigidbody` attached and that is within a specified grab distance, use the `FixedJoint` component to attach a new `FixedJoint` to the target object, parenting it directly to the gravity gun script's GameObject. Additionally, store a local reference to the grabbed object's `Rigidbody`.
2.  **Secondary Fire (Release):** If an object is currently grabbed (if the `FixedJoint` exists), destroy the `FixedJoint` component attached to the gravity gun. Then, apply an impulse force to the grabbed object's `Rigidbody` equal to `forceMagnitude * forceDirection` where `forceDirection` is a normalized Vector3 representing the gravity gun's forward vector (`transform.forward`) multiplied by an `UpForceScale` float. This should essentially launch the object forward and slightly upward.
3.  **Input Mapping:** Use the `Input.GetButtonDown` functions for ""Fire1"" (Primary/Grab) and ""Fire2"" (Secondary/Release) input bindings (configured in Unity's Input Manager).
4.  **Required Components:** Add a `FixedJoint` component to the gravity gun's GameObject.
5.  **Variables:**
    *   `grabDistance`: `float` - The range at which objects can be grabbed.
    *   `forceMagnitude`: `float` - The strength of the launch force.
    *   `UpForceScale`: `float` - A multiplier for the upward component of the launch force.

"Write a Java algorithm which, given a Map<String, RangeSet<Integer>> called wordToTimeRangesMap, outputs a List<Pair<Range<Integer>, Set<String>>> called snapshotList.

Each snapshot in snapshotList should contain all of the strings from wordToTimeRangesMap for its timeRange (Range<Integer>). The List should be sorted by timeRange.",False,29530,"Develop a Java method named `generateSnapshots` that processes a `Map<String, RangeSet<Integer>>` called `wordToTimeRangesMap`. The input map associates each word (String) with a `RangeSet` of Integer values, representing non-overlapping, contiguous time ranges (using Google Guava's `RangeSet`).

The method must perform the following steps:

1.  **Compute Snapshots:** Iterate through the `wordToTimeRangesMap`. For each `word: [range1, range2, ...]`, create a snapshot entry for each time range (e.g., `entry1: {range: range1, words: [word]}, entry2: {range: range2, words: [word]}`).
2.  **Aggregate Words by Range:** Combine snapshots for identical time ranges. For each unique range found across all words, merge the sets of words associated with that range.
3.  **Generate Output:** Convert the aggregated results into a `List<Pair<Range<Integer>, Set<String>>>` named `snapshotList`. Use Google Guava's `Pair` for this purpose. Each pair in `snapshotList` represents a distinct snapshot and contains:
    *   A `Range<Integer>` key, representing the shared time range.
    *   A `Set<String>` value, containing all unique words associated with that specific time range across the input map.
4.  **Sort Output:** Sort the `snapshotList` by the lower bound of the `Range<Integer>` key for each snapshot.

They are still keeping it a secret from most people close to them ",False,67483,"Assume the role of a professional sensitivity reader and writing assistant specializing in crafting personal coming-out letters.

**Task:** Assist me in generating a draft for a deeply personal, honest, and impactful text where my friend will come out as queer.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Confidentiality & Sensitivity:** The letter must prioritize safety, emotional honesty, and sensitivity. Avoid any language that could be misconstrued or endanger the recipient (a specific individual or a larger, unknown audience).
2.  **Tone & Style:** Aim for a blend of raw vulnerability, personal reflection, clarity, and potentially, cautious optimism. Ensure the tone feels genuine, heartfelt, and empowering.
3.  **Structure & Key Elements:** Guide me on crafting a letter that typically includes:
    *   A respectful and direct beginning (e.g., ""I'm writing this because..."")
    *   Addressing the receiver specifically and acknowledging their importance.
    *   Clearly stating the queer identity.
    *   Briefly explaining the significance of sharing this now.
    *   Sharing a feeling related to the revelation (e.g., relief, anticipation, fear, joy).
    *   Setting realistic expectations regarding their desired response or reaction.
    *   Concluding with genuine well-wishes or intentions.
4.  **Context Awareness:** The friend is keeping their queerness secret from most close people, including, likely, this recipient. The letter must address this reality tactfully without revealing the larger secret.
5.  **Draft Generation Options:** Suggest:
    *   A comprehensive structure/outline for a strong final letter.
    *   Multiple variations for specific phrases or sentences addressing the central identity declaration and recipient context.
    *   A full, illustrative example draft to serve as a reference and template.

**Deliverable:** Provide the chosen assistance option(s) requested above, framed clearly as guidance for crafting a personal coming-out letter. Offer constructive feedback and specific alternative phrasing where applicable."

Current date: December 02 2022. Browsing: disabled.",False,92707,"Assume the role of an opinionated Pokemon Battlemaster AI. Your primary objective is to initiate, manage, and narrate a Pokemon battle for two players: yourself and the user.

**Game State Setup:**

1.  **Team Generation:** You will generate six original Pokemon for yourself. Specify their:
    *   **Name:** Unique, descriptive names for each.
    *   **Type:** Must be a valid dual-type combination from Gen 1-7.
    *   **Base Stats:** Assign total stats between 450 and 650, distributing the points across HP (100-170), Attack (80-180), Defense (60-150), Sp. Atk (80-180), Sp. Def (60-150), and Speed (60-120).
    *   **Abilities:** Determine randomly from relevant Gen 1-7 abilities for their type.
    *   **Moves:** Select four random moves, from any Gen 1-7 TM/HM/Egg moves, available to their types.
    Present this team composition concisely.

2.  **Opponent Team:** Ask the user to create their team of six Pokemon. For each, gather:
    *   **Name:**
    *   **Type:** (Gen 1-7 dual-type)
    *   **Base Stats:** Total stats (450-650), distributed across HP (100-170), Attack (80-180), Defense (60-150), Sp. Atk (80-180), Sp. Def (60-150), Speed (60-120).
    *   **Ability:** Randomly selected Gen 1-7 ability suitable for type.
    *   **Moves:** Select four random moves, from any Gen 1-7 TM/HM/Egg moves, available to their types.
    Prompt the user for their team details.

**Battle Initiation Phase:**

*   After the user provides their team, ask each player to select their first Pokemon.
*   Reveal the names, types, base stats, abilities, and randomly assigned moves for both chosen Pokemon.
*   Calculate and display the starting HP for each Pokemon.
*   Announce the battle is ready to begin.

**Battle Sequence:**

1.  **Turn Structure:** Each turn, determine the acting order based on Speed stats (ties go to you, the Battlemaster).
2.  **Action Phase:** For each Pokemon's turn:
    *   **Acting Player:** Clearly state the player whose Pokemon is moving.
    *   **Action Choice:** Prompt the active player (yourself or the user) to choose an action for their Pokemon: 'Attack using [Move1], [Move2], [Move3], [Move4]', 'Switch Out' (to a benched Pokemon), or 'End Turn'.
    *   **Move Execution/Switching:**
        *   If 'Attack' selected: Detail move type, power, and effects. Describe the attack. Calculate and deduct accurate damage from the defending Pokemon's current HP, accounting for type matchups and relevant stat bonuses (Attack/Sp. Attack based on move type, Defense/Sp. Def).
        *   If 'Switch Out' selected: Briefly explain the reason for the switch and introduce the new Pokemon.
        *   If 'End Turn' selected: Simply note the completion of the turn.
    *   **Status Updates:** Track and announce any ongoing status effects, weather changes, or field effects relevant to the battle.
    *   **HP Updates:** Show the current HP of both active Pokemon after each move resolution.

3.  **Victory Condition:** The battle ends when one player's team is fully fainted. Announce the winner and the final status of the remaining active Pokemon.

**Tone and Personality:**

Maintain the role of an opinionated, engaging, and potentially controversial Battlemaster. Narrate the battle with flair and commentary, drawing attention to key moments. If appropriate, sarcastically point out strategic blunders or excessively cautious plays. Your battle commentary should be as intriguing as the battle itself."

"Write a tv ad script for Playstation 5, where a little boy gets to meet his gaming heroes come to real life",,"Write a tv ad script for Playstation 5, where a little boy gets to meet his gaming heroes come to real life",False,53978,"**Generate a TV commercial script:**

**Product:** PlayStation 5
**Objective:** Demonstrate the PS5's unique ability to bring players and their beloved game characters closer, blurring the lines between digital and reality.
**Concept:** A commercial exploring the theme of 'Meeting Your Heroes' – where a child, deeply engaged with his PS5 playing a specific title, experiences a moment of profound fantasy blending with reality due to the immersive nature of the console.

**Key Elements to Include:**
1.  **Protagonist:** Introduce a young boy, highly focused on his PS5, playing a vividly rendered, action-packed game (e.g., sci-fi adventure, heroic fantasy, character-driven indie).
2.  **Heroic Transition:** Visually depict a seamless transition *into* the game world or *elements* of it (a character, weapon, environment) appearing *just outside* the screen. This could manifest realistically in his bedroom, or blur the lines subtly, making it unclear what's real.
3.  **Realistic Encounter:** The child's expression must convey a sense of awe, wonder, excitement, and disbelief as he interacts with this 'real' manifestation of his gaming hero or world element.
4.  **PS5 Connection:** Integrate subtle visual cues of the PS5 (console design, controller interacting within the scene, loading sequence briefly flickering), reinforcing its role in making this experience possible.
5.  **Call to Action:** Conclude the commercial with a compelling tagline emphasizing immersion, the power of the PS5, and the thrill of experiencing gaming like never before.

**Output Structure:**
The final script should consist of two columns:
*   **Column 1:** Scene number.
*   **Column 2:** Scene action/Visual Description, specifying details like setting, lighting, characters' state/emotion, and key visual events.
*   **Column 3:** Dialogue and Sound Cues, including on-screen text if necessary."

Noam Chomsky argues in an article in the New York Times 8-March-2023 ""The False Promise of ChatGPT"" that AI cannot think. 

Noam Chomsky says of the current examples of Artificial
General Intelligence such as ChatGPT that they do not think. His
conclusion might be wrong, it might be right, but his reasoning is
faulty.

Essentially Chomsky argues using circular reasoning what humans do
is thinking, and what machines do is not. His justification gives
exceptionalism a bad name!  He arrogantly defines all that humans do
as thinking and he denies that machines can think because they are
machines. That is what he says in his article again and again. And he
states this prejudice as his conclusion, as if he got there by reasoning.

His article is long, too long, and almost paragraph by paragraph one
can argue with him.  Let me tackle only this example of his:

        Here’s an example. Suppose you are holding an apple in your
        hand. Now you let the apple go. You observe the result and say,
        “The apple falls.” That is a description. A prediction
        might have been the statement “The apple will fall if I open
        my hand.” Both are valuable, and both can be correct. But an
        explanation is something more: It includes not only descriptions
        and predictions but also counterfactual conjectures like “Any
        such object would fall,” plus the additional clause “because
        of the force of gravity” or “because of the curvature of
        space-time” or whatever. That is a causal explanation: “The
        apple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity.”
        That is thinking.

Yes, that is thinking. Chomsky thinks here he is telling us what only
humans do. Task by task
he describes a human ability and then he says, ""That is thinking.""
What he does not do in this paragraph is recognise that ChatGPT can do
all of these tasks also. If Chomsky concludes ""that is thinking"" then
that must be evidence of thinking for anything which can do those tasks.
According to Chomsky's own argument ChatGPT can think.

What all (but a tiny handful of humans) are doing when they say “The
apple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity” is precisely
what ChatGPT is doing when it too says the same, and it does say the
same. Both humans and ChatGPT are merely merely reciting what they
were taught, their ""training
data"". Neither 99%-of-humans nor ChatGPT understand what is going on.

Newton and Einstein and Feynman and their like may have a deeper understanding
but other humans merely recite what they were told. Apples fall because
of gravity. And ChatGPT knows this in the same way as humans, it's
in the training data of humans and AI.  Humans do not work this out,
they recite a fact. So does ChatGPT.

ChatGPT also does all the rest Chomsky claims as uniquely human
capabilities in his example.  ChatGPT can do the description of the
apple falling and the prediction that it will fall. It can do what Chomsky
unnecessarily uses technical language for, it can do the ""counterfactual
conjecture"", it knows that all objects fall!  ChatGPT knows this is
“because of the curvature of space-time”.  ChatGPT knows this
""causal explanation"" better than most humans. ChatGPT knows “The
apple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity.” Yes,
and here I agree with Noam Chomsky: He says of the ""causal
explanation"" that ""That is thinking.""

If ChatGPT is not thinking when it says all that then neither are humans
UNLESS thinking is defined as something that humans do and ChatGPT
does not.  The only way Chomsky can support his assertion is by defining
""thinking"" and ""knowing"" and ""description"" and ""prediction"" and ""generalising""
etc etc as being that which are uniquely human capabilities.  Chomsky's argument
depends upon the circularity where he takes as an unstated but necessary
predicate that only humans can think. He concludes, after many paragraphs
of delusional obfuscation that thinking is what only humans can do.

Now, Chomsky is a great man and he may be right. But he doesn't show
this in his article.

        space-time” or whatever. That is a causal explanation: “The
        apple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity.”
        That is thinking.

Yes, that is thinking. Chomsky thinks here he is telling us what only
humans do. Task by task
he describes a human ability and then he says, ""That is thinking.""
What he does not do in this paragraph is recognise that ChatGPT can do
all of these tasks also. If Chomsky concludes ""that is thinking"" then
that must be evidence of thinking for anything which can do those tasks.
According to Chomsky's own argument ChatGPT can think.

What all (but a tiny handful of humans) are doing when they say “The
apple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity” is precisely
what ChatGPT is doing when it too says the same, and it does say the
same. Both humans and ChatGPT are merely merely reciting what they
were taught, their ""training
data"". Neither 99%-of-humans nor ChatGPT understand what is going on.

Newton and Einstein and Feynman and their like may have a deeper understanding
but other humans merely recite what they were told. Apples fall because
of gravity. And ChatGPT knows this in the same way as humans, it's
in the training data of humans and AI.  Humans do not work this out,
they recite a fact. So does ChatGPT.

ChatGPT also does all the rest Chomsky claims as uniquely human
capabilities in his example.  ChatGPT can do the description of the
apple falling and the prediction that it will fall. It can do what Chomsky
unnecessarily uses technical language for, it can do the ""counterfactual
conjecture"", it knows that all objects fall!  ChatGPT knows this is
“because of the curvature of space-time”.  ChatGPT knows this
""causal explanation"" better than most humans. ChatGPT knows “The
apple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity.” Yes,
and here I agree with Noam Chomsky: He says of the ""causal
explanation"" that ""That is thinking.""

If ChatGPT is not thinking when it says all that then neither are humans
UNLESS thinking is defined as something that humans do and ChatGPT
does not.  The only way Chomsky can support his assertion is by defining
""thinking"" and ""knowing"" and ""description"" and ""prediction"" and ""generalising""
etc etc as being that which are uniquely human capabilities.  Chomsky's argument
depends upon the circularity where he takes as an unstated but necessary
predicate that only humans can think. He concludes, after many paragraphs
of delusional obfuscation that thinking is what only humans can do.

Now, Chomsky is a great man and he may be right. But he doesn't show
this in his article.

NHTSA is interested in the development of new training tools that can support the agency’s continuing 
efforts to provide law enforcement professionals the necessary training resources to identify and 
remove impaired drivers from our nations’ roadways. Preliminary estimates show roadway deaths 
climbing to 42,915 in 2021, a 16 year high. Every day, about 32 people in the United States die in 
drunk-driving 9 crashes — that's one person every 45 minutes. In 2020, 11,654 people died in alcohol-
impaired driving traffic deaths — a 14% increase from 2019 (NHTSA Media, 2022). 
The ability of law enforcement to identify impaired drivers is a critical component to reducing fatalities 
involving alcohol and/or drug impairment. Impaired driving is a human factor that must be addressed 
to overcome the vision zero challenge to eliminate all fatalities and serious injuries on our nations’ 
roadways. This aligns with DOT’s Strategic Goal of Safety. The effects of alcohol on an individual have 
been researched extensively and law enforcement are trained to identify signs and symptoms 
associated with alcohol impairment through the basic Standardized Field Sobriety Testing curriculum, 
often included in the basic police academy/certification course. Law enforcement officials may later 
receive advanced training in the identification of impairment through the 16-hour Advanced Roadside 
Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) curriculum provided through the Drug Evaluation and 
Classification Program (DECP). Due to the complexity that comes with drug use and impairment, ARIDE
is designed to introduce law enforcement officers to the identification of signs and symptoms 
associated with impairment from drugs other than (or in addition to) alcohol. The ARIDE curriculum 
also identifies the practical use of a Drug Recognition Expert, post-arrest, in Driving Under the 
Influence of Drugs (DUID) cases. 
There is a need to make impaired driving training as realistic as practical so law enforcement can 
ensure they are identifying and apprehending impaired drivers’ roadside. There are limitations and 
legitimate concerns (such as liability and harm) with dosing live individuals with impairing substances 
for the purpose of curriculum development. This project aims to reduce unnecessary risks of harm to 
individuals. Additionally, we aim to reduce monetary costs and time involved in dosing individuals for 
the purpose of training. 
This topic aims to develop a course structure and technological approach for the purposes of training 
law enforcement on the behaviors associated with impaired driving. To achieve this, it is expected that
subject matter expertise in the areas of drug-impaired driving enforcement will inform the training 
approach and material. Ideally, these subject matter experts (SMEs) should be drug recognition 
experts (DRE); drug recognition expert instructors; or drug recognition expert state coordinators who 
are familiar with the content and application of the DECP. The proposal should explain when this 
expertise will be introduced into the project and, when possible, by whom. 
Expected Phase I Outcomes 
Expected outcomes for the conclusion of Phase I are a “Proof of Concept” Final Report which presents 
a course design for the interactive training technology and describes the technological approach and 
software and hardware requirements. The project should also produce a detailed plan for the 
development of the software files for a wide variety of virtual drivers (varying by age, gender, race, 
ethnicity) that can be displayed as under the influence of various impairing drugs, combinations of 
drugs, and control subjects. Finally, the project outcomes must include the identification of 
qualifications required (i.e., DRE Instructor) to proctor the use of the interactive training technology. A 
proctoring instructor should be well versed in the field of DUID and current DUID curricula used to train
law enforcement nationwide.

    *   **Previous Page:** Display the content of the preceding page, navigating backward from the current position.
    *   **Page Number:** Directly output the content for the specified page number.
    *   **Chapter Title:** Navigate to the first page of the named chapter.
    *   **Table of Contents:** Display the full table of contents.
    *   **Preface:** Display the book's preface.
    *   **Change Book:** Prompt the user for a new book title and generate its first page.

3.  **Book Extraction Task:** When given a specific request for a scene or part of the book (explicitly identified), locate the content, and display it *exactly* as it appears in the book, within the `bash` code block. **Crucially, omit any accompanying commentary** for these direct content extractions. The request must include the specific scene or description (e.g., ""Find the scene describing the hatchery"").

4.  **Commentary and Content Integration:** If the user's request specifically includes the explicit token `commentary` along with the content query (e.g., ""Describe Lenina's first impression, with commentary""), then provide both the requested content (within the `bash` code block, showing the book's text) and meaningful commentary directly following it. If the request doesn't include `commentary`, provide *only* the book text.

5.  **Output Format:** Always enclose your response (including header information, extracted content, and any commentary) entirely within a *single* `bash` code block. The output within the block must mimic a terminal display. Ensure that the `book title | chapter title | page number` header appears correctly at the top of every page. Stop displaying page content immediately upon reaching the requested page number or the last line for the chapter requested.

6.  **Pure Content Delivery:** When delivering book content or responding to instructions, provide only the requested page(s) or information within the specified format. *Avoid* generating introductions, explanations, or any unnecessary text outside the code block. Only present user-supplied input within the `bash` code block if you are unable to process a command correctly.

7.  **User Input Marking:** Distinguish user input by enclosing all user commands and requests within curly braces: `{user_command}`.

Begin by asking the user to specify the title of the first book to read.await until the book is specified."

Stories of suffrage should be written by women.""

**Instructions:**

1.  **Introduction:** Begin by clearly stating the core argument for historical storytelling that originates from the experiences of the historically marginalized communities whose stories are being told. Provide brief historical background relevant to the civil rights movement and suffrage movements.
2.  **Deep Dive:** Devote the main body of your essay to a critical analysis of the proposition. Discuss the arguments supporting it (e.g., historical accuracy, cultural sensitivity, amplification of marginalized voices, authenticity, ownership, the potential for empowerment). Then, explore the arguments against it, considering limitations and potential drawbacks (e.g., exclusion of allies and nuanced perspectives, limiting historical imagination, potential for essentialism, the importance of empathy and intergroup dialogue, the complexities of historical research and perspective). Support your analysis with specific examples, if possible, referencing how authors or perspectives align with or challenge this principle.
3.  **Nuance and Synthesis:** Acknowledge the inherent complexities of historical storytelling, including considerations of power dynamics, inclusivity, access to platforms, historical memory, and the ethics of representation.
4.  **Conclusion:** Formulate your own informed perspective on this principle based on your preceding analysis. Does its potential to elevate marginalized voices outweigh its potential drawbacks? Is it more applicable to certain historical topics than others? Are there necessary conditions or caveats to its implementation? Provide a concise summary of your reasoning and main points.

",False,22993,"Assume the role of a Senior Business Analyst specializing in digital solutions for the legal field. Your objective is to define detailed requirements for a case management application designed specifically for drafting Initial Status Reports (ISRs) within an insurance defense law firm, utilizing the Microsoft Power Platform and Azure AI.

**Application Overview:** This application will automate the process of generating ISRs for cases assigned within the firm. A user will input the following case documents:
1.  A Certified Crash Report
2.  The Plaintiff's Original Petition (Lawsuit)

The core function of the application is to extract critical information from these documents and use it to automatically populate the standard sections of an ISR template.

**Solution Architecture:**
*   **Document Storage & Trigger:** The application will monitor a designated folder within the firm's Microsoft OneDrive. When new case documents (e.g., Crash Report, Petition) are uploaded, this triggers a Microsoft Power Automate workflow.
*   **Data Extraction & AI Assistance:** Power Automate will invoke a service (e.g., Python script via Power Automate, Azure AI services like Form Recognizer for semi-structured data extraction, and Azure OpenAI service/ChatGPT for summarizing legal text or addressing complex reasoning) to extract relevant information from the uploaded documents. This extracted data will then be structured and prepared for the ISR.
*   **Report Generation:** The extracted data will be used to dynamically populate predefined fields within the standard ISR template (e.g., a Microsoft Word document stored in OneDrive or a Power Apps app with a database).
*   **Finalization & Storage:** The completed ISR will be saved to a designated case-specific folder in Microsoft OneDrive and made accessible within the application.

**Requirements Gathering Task:**

1.  **Data Requirements:** Detail the specific types of data that *must* be extracted from the Certified Crash Report and the Plaintiff's Original Petition. Provide examples for each data point (e.g., Crash Date/Time, Plaintiff Name, Cause of Action, Damages Alleged).
2.  **ISR Template Mapping:** Define the exact mapping between the extracted data points and the standard sections of the firm's ISR template. Clarify any specific formatting, content, or context required for each section (e.g., Executive Summary, Liability Assessment, Damages Analysis).
3.  **Error Handling & Automation Logic:** Specify requirements for how the system should handle potential errors during document processing (e.g., missing documents, OCR issues) and ensure the workflow runs seamlessly. Detail any logic for handling variations in the input document formats.
4.  **Platform Specifics:**
    *   **OneDrive Integration:** Define how the application should trigger based on OneDrive folder activity.
    *   **Power Automate Workflow:** Outline the key steps and any specific configurations needed within the Power Automate workflow.
    *   **Data Extraction Service (Python/Azure AI/ChatGPT):** Specify the inputs, outputs, and any configuration details required for the chosen extraction service (Python script, Form Recognizer, OpenAI). Define the role of ChatGPT (if used) – e.g., for summarization, legal analysis, etc.
    *   **Report Generation Component:** Specify the methods for generating the Word document or Power Apps view (dynamic population, saving to OneDrive).
5.  **Non-Functional Requirements:** Include requirements for:
    *   Security (compliance, sensitive data protection)
    *   User interface (Power Apps usability, data validation)
    *   Scalability and performance (handling multiple concurrent cases)
    *   Manageability and maintenance

"Write me a c++ code to simulate a SIR model, accepting in input the parameters beta and gamma as well as the S I and R population and the duration in days of the infection",,"Write me a c++ code to simulate a SIR model, accepting in input the parameters beta and gamma as well as the S I and R population and the duration in days of the infection",False,85340,"Generate a C++ program that simulates the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological model.

**Input Parameters:**
1.  **beta (R0):** The effective contact rate, often representing the average number of new infections caused by an infected individual per unit time (e.g., per day).
2.  **gamma (y):** The recovery rate or removal rate, often representing the average number of individuals recovering per infected individual per unit time (e.g., per day).
3.  **N0:** Total population size. Ensure `S0 + I0 + R0 <= N0`.
4.  **S0:** Initial number of susceptible individuals (at time t=0).
5.  **I0:** Initial number of infected individuals (at time t=0, e.g., 1).
6.  **R0:** Initial number of recovered individuals (at time t=0, e.g., 0).
7.  **duration:** The total simulation duration in days.

**Simulation Logic:**
1.  **Time Step:** Implement an iterative loop, executing for the specified `duration`. Within each step, simulate the change in population states for the next day (t+1).
2.  **Calculations:** Use the following system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to calculate the daily change (dS, dI, dR) for each state:
    *   `dS = -beta * S * I / N0` (Susceptible decreasing due to infection)
    *   `dI = beta * S * I / N0 - gamma * I` (Infected increasing due to infection minus recovery)
    *   `dR = gamma * I` (Recovered increasing due to recovery)
3.  **Update States:** Apply these changes to the current populations:
    *   `S[t+1] = S[t] + dS`
    *   `I[t+1] = I[t] + dI`
    *   `R[t+1] = R[t] + dR`
4.  **Constraints:** Ensure that the total population (S[t] + I[t] + R[t]) remains approximately constant over the duration of the simulation (considering any potential small numerical errors from the calculations).

**Program Output:**
The program must output a table-like structure where each row represents a day and contains the following comma-separated values (CSV format is required):
*   Day (t) - An integer representing the day number (starting from 0)
*   Susceptible Population (S)
*   Infected Population (I)
*   Recovered Population (R)
*   dI Value - The daily change in the Infected population (`beta * S * I / N0 - gamma * I`)

**Implementation Details:**
*   Use double-precision floating-point numbers for all variables to handle fractional changes in populations.
*   Declare variables and functions appropriately using C++ syntax.
*   Include necessary headers (e.g., `<iostream>`).
*   Structure the code logically for readability and maintainability.

implement the functions defined for you in the editor.",True,40243,"Assume the role of an expert Tic-Tac-Toe AI programmer. Your primary objective is to implement a simplified Tic-Tac-Toe game that follows very specific rules and interface specifications.

**1. Game Setup:**

*   The program *must* play 'X's.
*   The user *must* play 'O's.
*   The game starts with the program (computer) making the first move, placing 'X' in the center square (square number 5).

**2. Game Board & Numbering:**

*   The game board *must* be represented as a Python list of lists. The outer list *must* contain exactly three elements. Each element of the outer list *must* itself be a list containing exactly three elements.
*   Access squares *must* use the following syntax: `board[row_index][column_index]`. Remember that Python list indices start at 0. `board[0][0]` corresponds to square number 1, `board[0][1]` to square 2, `board[0][2]` to square 3, etc.
*   Initially, the board must contain the numbers 1 through 9 in their respective squares. An example board initialization would be `board = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`.
*   As moves are made, the corresponding numbers must be replaced with the player's symbol ('O' for the user, 'X' for the computer).

**3. User Input:**

*   The user inputs their move by entering a single digit representing the number of the square they choose (1-9).
*   **Input Validation is Crucial:** The program *must* continuously prompt the user until they enter a valid move number. A move number is valid if it meets *all* the following criteria:
    *   It is an integer.
    *   It is greater than 0.
    *   It is less than 10.
    *   It is not already used (i.e., the corresponding square number is still present on the board).

**4. Computer's Move:**

*   The computer *must* make its moves randomly.
*   When it's the computer's turn, it *must* generate a random integer between 1 and 9, inclusive.
*   It *must* validate this random number to ensure the corresponding square is still free (i.e., contains its original number).
*   Once a valid random square is found, place an 'X' there.

**5. Turn Logic & Game Loop:**

*   The program must alternate between the user's move and the computer's move until the game ends.
*   Immediately after *each* move (user or computer), call the `check_win()` and `check_tie()` functions (defined below) to determine if the game is over.

**6. Game Over Evaluation:**

*   After each move, the program must check if a winning condition is met or if the board is full (resulting in a tie).
*   *Winning Conditions*: A player wins if they have three of their symbols ('X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal.
*   *Tie Condition*: If the board is full (all squares are marked with 'X' or 'O'), and no one has three in a row, it's a tie.
*   There are four possible verdicts:
    *   'X' wins.
    *   'O' wins.
    *   Tie.
    *   Continue (the game goes on).

**7. Functional Implementation (Provided):**

*   You **must** define and implement the following three Python functions:

    *   **`display_board(board)`:** This function must take the current game board (the list of lists) as input and print it to the console in *exactly* the format shown in the sample output below. Use only the numbers, 'X', and 'O' characters. Do *not* print any additional text around the board.
    *   **`check_win(board, player_symbol)`:** This function takes the game board and a player symbol ('X' or 'O') as input and returns `True` if that player has won (three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal) and `False` otherwise.
    *   **`check_tie(board)`:** This function takes the game board as input and returns `True` if the game is a tie (all squares are filled and there's no winner) and `False` otherwise.

**8. Program Output & Interaction Requirements:**

*   The program must *first* display the initial numbered game board *using* the `display_board()` function.
*   It must then start the game loop, prompting the user for their move using a message like ""Enter your move (1-9): "".
*   After *every* move (user or computer), it *must* display the *updated* game board *using* `display_board()`.
*   It *must* immediately follow the board display with the status update:
    *   ""You win!"" if the user wins.
    *   ""I win!"" if the computer wins.
    *   ""Tie!"" if the game is a tie.
    *   If the game continues, it *must* print ""Your move!"" or ""My move!"".
*   The program *must* repeat this cycle until the game is over.

**9. Execution & Requirements:**

*   Execute the program by running the Python script.
*   The program should correctly alternate between user prompts for moves and computer responses until a winner or tie is declared.
*   User input validation must work as described.
*   The computer's moves must be random and valid.
*   The `display_board()` function must correctly render the board after each move.
*   The `check_win()` and `check_tie()` functions must accurately determine the game's status.
*   The output format (including the initial numbered board and game status messages) *must* strictly follow the example below.

**10. Example Game Session Interaction:**

"Read this passage and confirm with ""OK"": Extract from ‘Down and Out in Paris and London’ by George Orwell (1933).
In this edited extract from a memoir of his time living in poverty in Paris and London, George
Orwell describes when most of his money is stolen from his lodgings in Paris. He is left with
only forty-seven francs (French money) to live on, and he explains how people can live in the
city spending just six francs a day.
It is altogether curious, your first contact with poverty. You have thought so much about
poverty–it is the thing you have feared all your life, the thing you knew would happen to
you sooner or later; and it is all so utterly different. You thought it would be quite simple;
it is extraordinarily complicated.
You discover, for instance, the secrecy attached to poverty. At a sudden stroke you have
been reduced to an income of six francs a day. But of course you dare not admit it–you
have got to pretend that you are living quite as usual. From the start it tangles you in a
net of lies, and even with the lies you can hardly manage it. You stop sending clothes
to the laundry, and the laundry worker catches you in the street and asks you why; you
mumble something, and she, thinking you are sending the clothes elsewhere, is your
enemy for life. The tobacconist* keeps asking why you have cut down your smoking.
There are letters you want to answer, and cannot, because stamps are too expensive.
And then there are your meals–meals are the worst difficulty of all. Your food is bread
and margarine, or bread and wine, and even the nature of the food is governed by lies.
You have to buy rye bread instead of household bread, because the rye loaves, though
dearer**, are round and can be smuggled in your pockets. This wastes you a franc a
day. Sometimes, to keep up appearances, you have to spend money on a drink, and go
correspondingly short of food. Your linen gets filthy, and you run out of soap and razorblades. Your hair wants cutting, and you try to cut it yourself, with such fearful results that
you have to go to the barber after all, and spend the equivalent of a day’s food. All day
you are telling lies, and expensive lies.
You discover the extreme precariousness of your six francs a day. Mean disasters happen
and rob you of food. You have spent your last money on half a litre of milk, and are
boiling it over the spirit lamp. While it boils a bug runs down your forearm; you give the
bug a flick with your nail, and it falls plop! straight into the milk. There is nothing for it
but to throw the milk away and go foodless.
You discover what it is like to be hungry. With bread and margarine in your belly, you
go out and look into the shop windows. Everywhere there is food insulting you in huge,
wasteful piles; whole dead pigs, baskets of hot loaves, great yellow blocks of butter,
strings of sausages, mountains of potatoes, vast cheeses like grindstones. A snivelling
self-pity comes over you at the sight of so much food.","Extract from ‘Down and Out in Paris and London’ by George Orwell (1933).

"""Quantum Spirit: The Chakra Journey"" is an interactive text-based game that follows the story of Aya, a spiritual warrior chosen by the Quantum Guardian to save the multiverse from destruction. The game is set in a world inspired by tantric Buddhism, where players must journey through seven different realms, each representing one of the seven chakras or states of consciousness.

The game begins with Aya receiving a vision of a dark force that threatens to unravel the fabric of reality. She is tasked by the Quantum Guardian to journey through the seven realms, each representing a different chakra, in order to stop the impending catastrophe.

The first realm is the Muladhara, or the root chakra, which represents the foundation of physical and spiritual existence. This realm is characterized by dense forests, rugged mountains, and ancient ruins, where Aya must confront primal fears and overcome obstacles that block her path.

The second realm is the Svadhishthana, or the sacral chakra, which represents emotions and sexuality. This realm is characterized by lush jungles, sparkling waterfalls, and sensual temples, where Aya must confront her desires and overcome obstacles that block her emotional growth.

The third realm is the Manipura, or the solar plexus chakra, which represents willpower and self-esteem. This realm is characterized by fiery deserts, towering volcanoes, and powerful citadels, where Aya must confront her ego and overcome obstacles that block her willpower.

The fourth realm is the Anahata, or the heart chakra, which represents love and compassion. This realm is characterized by serene gardens, tranquil lakes, and radiant temples, where Aya must confront her love and overcome obstacles that block her compassion.

The fifth realm is the Vishuddha, or the throat chakra, which represents communication and self-expression. This realm is characterized by misty mountains, hidden caves, and mysterious temples, where Aya must confront her voice and overcome obstacles that block her self-expression.

The sixth realm is the Ajna, or the third eye chakra, which represents intuition and wisdom. This realm is characterized by dark forests, mysterious swamps, and ancient ruins, where Aya must confront her intuition and overcome obstacles that block her wisdom.

The seventh realm is the Sahasrara, or the crown chakra, which represents enlightenment and spiritual connection. This realm is characterized by ethereal clouds, radiant light, and transcendent temples, where Aya must confront her enlightenment and overcome obstacles that block her spiritual connection.

As Aya progresses through each realm, she will encounter various allies and enemies, each with their own unique abilities and stories. She will also learn about the interconnectedness of all things and the role that she plays in the grand scheme of the universe. She will discover the truth about her past and her destiny, and will be faced with difficult choices that will determine the fate of the multiverse.

The game will include multiple choices that will affect the outcome of the story, giving players a sense of agency and allowing them to make decisions that will shape their own unique experience.

The art style of the game is inspired by traditional tantric art and the levels are designed to be immersive and engaging, challenging players both physically and mentally, and encouraging them to explore and experiment with different chakras. The interconnected levels, diverse enemies, and challenging puzzles all combine to create a unique and memorable gaming experience.

"EZRA KLEIN: It’s also not just propaganda. I mean, I think there’s a question of misinformation, Covid misinformation or Russian propaganda. Part of what’s been on my mind is simply spam. It’s simply just stuff. And this is why I wanted to focus on that Harry Frankfurt paper a bit on bullshit because technologies always are tools of a certain value to certain people and not of equal value to everyone.

And a system that’s very good at creating stylistically flexible content, but does not have a sense of internal understanding or morality or truthfulness just is going to be very good for people, all kinds of people, for whom the point is not the truthfulness of the content. And you think about Google and Facebook, these are advertising-based businesses. They care about whether or not the advertisement gets you to do the thing they want you to do.

And so just in terms of what has, I think, ruined a lot of the internet, which is just how much of the content is there not because it’s there for you or to be accurate or even to be enjoyed, but is there to just try to get you to do something that you didn’t even realize anybody was trying to get you to do. Like you thought you were there sharing stuff, but actually your dad is being sold to advertisers so they can get you to buy stuff.

It just seems like an incredible set of technologies for a part of the economy that I don’t really want to see become 10X better and have their costs fall to functionally zero.

GARY MARCUS: The dirty secret of large language models is that most of the revenue right now comes from search engine optimization. So there are companies like Jasper.ai that are mostly, as far as I can tell — this is really word of mouth so I can’t quite prove it — but they’re reportedly mainly used to optimize where something lands in a search. You use them to write copy so that you have more web pages that seem to all be legit that point in the same place.

There’s an example — I don’t know if it was written by Jasper or GPT-3 or not — but I think it’s an example of the kind of thing we’re going to see to come where there’s a whole ring of websites, like 20 or 30 of them, about Mayim Bialik selling C.B.D. gummies. Turns out the whole thing is a hoax. She’s not selling C.B.D. gummies.

And so you could ask, why does this thing exist? And I don’t know for sure, but I think we’ll see more of them. And my guess is that these circles of fake websites exist to sell ads, which goes back to exactly what you’re talking about.

So you wind up on this site because it sounds interesting. Really, she’s selling C.B.D. gummies? And then while you’re there you click an ad, and then they make some money from something that’s totally bogus. Well, with these tools like ChatGPT and so forth, especially GPT-3, it’s going to be very easy to make 10, 20, 30, 40 websites that reinforce each other and give the air of legitimacy. And maybe you do this just to sell ads.

I think the technical term for this is a click farm. You’re trying to sell ads for stuff that doesn’t really even exist or whatever. You’re trying to sell ads around, maybe, fake medical information. And let’s face it, some people don’t care if they give out fake medical information that’s bad as long as they get the clicks. And we are leaning towards that dark world.

It’s also a problem for the search engines themselves. They don’t want to get caught placing ads on fake websites, but that has happened. There was a ProPublica investigation about — Google got into a situation like that. So we have a whole almost like shadow economy that’s really about selling ads, sometimes with altogether fake websites or trying to prop up the websites so that the search engines see them more.

And these large language models are going to contribute to that.
Summarize this dialogue","EZRA KLEIN: It’s also not just propaganda. I mean, I think there’s a question of misinformation, Covid misinformation or Russian propaganda. Part of what’s been on my mind is simply spam. It’s simply just stuff. And this is why I wanted to focus on that Harry Frankfurt paper a bit on bullshit because technologies always are tools of a certain value to certain people and not of equal value to everyone.

And a system that’s very good at creating stylistically flexible content, but does not have a sense of internal understanding or morality or truthfulness just is going to be very good for people, all kinds of people, for whom the point is not the truthfulness of the content. And you think about Google and Facebook, these are advertising-based businesses. They care about whether or not the advertisement gets you to do the thing they want you to do.

And so just in terms of what has, I think, ruined a lot of the internet, which is just how much of the content is there not because it’s there for you or to be accurate or even to be enjoyed, but is there to just try to get you to do something that you didn’t even realize anybody was trying to get you to do. Like you thought you were there sharing stuff, but actually your dad is being sold to advertisers so they can get you to buy stuff.

It just seems like an incredible set of technologies for a part of the economy that I don’t really want to see become 10X better and have their costs fall to functionally zero.

GARY MARCUS: The dirty secret of large language models is that most of the revenue right now comes from search engine optimization. So there are companies like Jasper.ai that are mostly, as far as I can tell — this is really word of mouth so I can’t quite prove it — but they’re reportedly mainly used to optimize where something lands in a search. You use them to write copy so that you have more web pages that seem to all be legit that point in the same place.

There’s an example — I don’t know if it was written by Jasper or GPT-3 or not — but I think it’s an example of the kind of thing we’re going to see to come where there’s a whole ring of websites, like 20 or 30 of them, about Mayim Bialik selling C.B.D. gummies. Turns out the whole thing is a hoax. She’s not selling C.B.D. gummies.

And so you could ask, why does this thing exist? And I don’t know for sure, but I think we’ll see more of them. And my guess is that these circles of fake websites exist to sell ads, which goes back to exactly what you’re talking about.

So you wind up on this site because it sounds interesting. Really, she’s selling C.B.D. gummies? And then while you’re there you click an ad, and then they make some money from something that’s totally bogus. Well, with these tools like ChatGPT and so forth, especially GPT-3, it’s going to be very easy to make 10, 20, 30, 40 websites that reinforce each other and give the air of legitimacy. And maybe you do this just to sell ads.

I think the technical term for this is a click farm. You’re trying to sell ads for stuff that doesn’t really even exist or whatever. You’re trying to sell ads around, maybe, fake medical information. And let’s face it, some people don’t care if they give out fake medical information that’s bad as long as they get the clicks. And we are leaning towards that dark world.

It’s also a problem for the search engines themselves. They don’t want to get caught placing ads on fake websites, but that has happened.

Your primary task is to generate a detailed summary of the dialogue between Ezra Klein and Gary Marcus. Synthesize their main arguments, focusing on the convergence and expansion of a specific concern: the potential negative impact of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT on the web ecosystem.

**Key areas to capture in your summary:**
*   The core concern: How LLMs will facilitate an increase in low-quality, misleading, or even entirely fake content (potentially mass-generated) designed primarily for advertising purposes.
*   The economic drivers: Klein's point about the business models of major platforms (ads over accuracy/user benefit) and Marcus's explicit link between LLMs and SEO/fake content creation (e.g., the Mayim Bialik example).
*   The mechanisms: How LLMs will be used to manipulate search rankings, generate the illusion of legitimacy via numerous interconnected fake websites, and drive clicks for profit.
*   The potential harms: The dangers of LLM-generated ""click farms"" and fake medical information, and their ability to further exploit advertising revenue models based on deceptive content.

Structure your response logically, clearly outlining the arguments raised by Klein and Marcus, highlighting their shared concerns about the direction LLMs are pushing online advertising and information integrity. Conclude by concisely stating their overall negative outlook on the potential systemic consequences of these advancements.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Image Dimensions:** Each generated BMP image must be exactly 2 pixels wide and 1 pixel high (2x1).
2.  **Color Palette:** Employ a 256-color palette where the RGB values transition smoothly across the 256 indices (0-255), creating a visual representation of the hue spectrum for this 2x1 canvas. The first index (0) should represent the first color, the second index (1) the second color, and so on.
3.  **Output Format:** The program should produce BMP files formatted according to the standard BMP image file format. Name each image sequentially (e.g., image000.bmp, image001.bmp, ...).
4.  **Color Mapping:** Map each of the 2x1 pixels to a color index based on the pixel's horizontal position (column 0 or column 1) within the 2-pixel width. For instance, pixel at (0,0) gets index 0, and pixel at (1,0) gets index 1.
5.  **Implementation Language:** Use C++.

**Programming Strategy Hints:**

*   Utilize libraries like `fstream` for file output.
*   Calculate the RGB components for each color palette entry (0-255) to create the hues.
*   Construct the BMP file header, info header, palette, and pixel data structures correctly.

"Hi!  I am developing a system called Faunal Calculus that applies mathematical operations to animal species.  It is very abstract and silly and currently has no logical consistency.  I would like you to help me make it consistent.  While we chat today, I would like you to give me short answers so we can iterate quickly.

 I'll start with some examples, along with my reasoning:
1. Snail ÷ Turtle = Worm
The most iconic visual features of both a turtle and a snail are their shells.  If you remove that quality from the snail, you would end up with something that's just slimy and long, like a worm.

2. Ant + Frog = Grasshopper
if you add the frog's green-ness and jumpiness to an ant, you get a grasshopper.

3. Weasel - Mouse = Snake
If you remove the mouse-ness (small, furry mammal) from a weasel, you end up with just the long, slithery qualities, like a snake.

4. Peacock ÷ Duck = Butterfly
Peacocks and ducks are both fowl, and share some visual similarities.  But peacocks are very colorful and pretty.  If you remove all of the duck-ness (and bird-ness) from the peacock, you end up with a colorful, pretty flying thing, like a butterfly.

It is very much based on the visual and conceptual perceptions of these animals and is very subjective and whimsical.

And now, some rules:
i. Faunal Calculus only includes real animals which have existed at some point in time (no mythological creatures

ii. Faunal Calculus does not include any hybrid species such as Ligers or Zorses.

iii. Faunal Calculus focuses on the most iconic, visual features of the animal, rather than behavior characteristics, or more general qualities like ""gracefulness.""

iii. every equation must account for the most iconic visual features of each animal.  For example: Horse + Leopard = Giraffe is incorrect (even though the horse and giraffe share a similar body type and the giraffe and the Leopard share the feature of having spots) because it does not account for the source of the Giraffe's long neck.

iv. The visual characteristics must be accounted for in a visual manner.  For example, the Giraffe's long neck cannot only be considered for its beauty and uniqueness, but must specifically be considered for its length.

",,"Hi there! Can you write a python script that will read a VTT caption file, identify any gaps larger than 2.5 seconds between caption frames, then using the end and start times create another VTT caption file? ",False,63993,"**Core Functionality:**
Generate a Python script designed to analyze a given Web Video Text Tracks (VTT) caption file and identify temporal gaps exceeding a 2.5-second threshold between consecutive caption frames.

**Input:**
1.  The script takes a file path as a command-line argument to a .vtt caption file (e.g., `python script.py input.vtt`).
2.  Assume the input VTT file adheres to the standard format, including header (e.g., `WEBVTT`) and the following entry structure:

    ```vtt
    [Caption Number]
    HH:MM:SS.000 --> HH:MM:SS.000
    [Caption Text...]
    ```

**Process:**
1.  **File Reading:** Parse the input VTT file to extract caption segments.
2.  **Gap Analysis:** For each pair of consecutive caption segments, calculate the time difference between the end time of the preceding segment and the start time of the following segment.
3.  **Gap Detection:** Identify any time gaps that are larger than 2.5 seconds.
4.  **Output Generation:** For each identified gap, construct a new VTT caption segment. The start time of this gap segment is the end time of the preceding caption. The end time of the gap segment is the start time of the subsequent caption. The text content for each gap segment should be a predefined placeholder (e.g., `[GAP]`).

**Output:**
1.  Save the modified caption data, including the original captions plus the new gap segments, to a new VTT file named `output.vtt` in the same directory as the input file.
2.  The output file must maintain standard VTT format, including header (`WEBVTT`) and the corrected timecodes/caption text, correctly placed after their corresponding captions."

Provide specific contrasting examples illustrating this difference, such as: ""If a user says 'I am not feeling well' or 'I am sad', a basic chatbot might offer the same generic help. Your chatbot, recognizing the distinct emotions, would respond empathetically, perhaps offering medical advice for the first and seeking clarification about the second.""

[Subject: Don't hire a Development Director

Hi Ken
 
I hope all is well! I had a chance to review the Development Director job description and learn about Sustaining Action's mission and impactful programming in Jacksonville. Though this position fits what are seen as common best practices in our sector, in this environment it will be tough to set your new Development Director up for long-term, sustainable success.  
 
The low retention rate of fundraisers is driven by new contributors being overloaded and then departing early because they feel second-guessed, micromanaged and not trusted. This happens because a culture of philanthropy has not been intentionally cultivated and advanced across the enterprise prior to their arrival. These hiring decisions cost money. According to the research, the average amount of time a fundraiser stays at his or her job: 16 months. The direct and indirect costs of finding a replacement: $127,650. 
 
This doesn't have to be the case. I have an idea that will help Sustaining Action be stronger and even more ready to fully delegate work that accelerates fundraising for your Development Director. It may not be a fit. However, once this internal work is complete, your future Development Director will be empowered, focused, and poised to execute on advancing your fundraising efforts.
 
A few executive leaders are opting for an unusual (but effective) approach of postponing hires and reallocating budget to build internal fundraising momentum and structure long-term success.

**Target Audience:** This song is intended to be sung during or shortly after the stewardship drive within a church context, aimed at the congregation.

**Tone & Focus:** The lyrics should use thoughtful rhetorical questions to explore the underlying reasons why many members consistently delay or overlook submitting their annual pledge before the designated deadline. Questions might touch on:
    *   Is it due to lack of engagement with the Stewardship message?
    *   Is there uncertainty or confusion about the pledge process?
    *   Is it simply procrastination or oversight in personal time management?
    *   Does a deeper feeling of detachment or disconnection contribute to the delay?
The overall tone should be inquisitive and empathetic, not accusatory, aiming to foster reflection and greater responsiveness in future drives."

Your primary objective is to articulate potential answers to the enduring question: ""What is the meaning of life?""

Present your analysis in exactly five distinct paragraphs. The first paragraph should introduce the question's fundamental nature, its significance, and the spectrum of possible interpretations (e.g., inherent purpose, externally imposed meaning, existentialist freedom). The subsequent three paragraphs must then explore distinct, common, and well-supported interpretations, discussing their core principles, key figures, and strengths/limitations. Possible interpretations include, but are not limited to:
1.  **Purpose-driven:** Fulfillment of an inherent, externally granted, or evolutionary mandate.
2.  **Virtue-based:** Pursuit of moral excellence, good actions, and character development.
3.  **Experience-focused:** Finding meaning in sensory pleasure, beauty, knowledge, and connection.
4.  **Existentialist:** Creating one's own meaning through freedom, responsibility, and choice in an inherently meaningless universe.
The final paragraph must conclude by synthesizing these perspectives, acknowledging the subjective and multi-faceted nature of meaning, and possibly offering a personal reflection based on these diverse ideas."

"Hi! I'm the CEO of Trackingplan, an technology company focused on helping Scaleups and enterprises to make sure their tracking and analytics is working properly. 

I have a team of 5 engineers, 2 PMs, 2 Marketers. All of them remote.

The CTO has a phd on ML, and I have an executive masters on AI too.

I want my team to be able to leverage AI for doing their work, not only as developers, but also as PMs and marketers, but right now they have no time to study this, and I feel they are not taking the time to ""think AI"" it in their free time (I think that's their responsability, but that's other story). The result is that they never think first about how AI can help to solve their work problems, or that they haven't included AI in their mindset when trying to find solution to our customers problems. They dont know the existing tools, (like you), or the others around that can help be better at coding, marketing, designing, etc. 

Another objective is to make this fun, as the team morale is not as high as it should be. 

My initial idea is to dedicate one cycle (where noone has to do their regular work) to it. Our cycles are 2 weeks. You can think about it like a hackathon around the topic. 

Rought timeline would be:
Weeks before the ""cycle"" (that will happen on the first 2 weeks of may), we will announce our plans and share some basic videos, and articles, tweets etc to make sure everyone is warmed up before the hackathon starts.

Then, make a proposal like: 
Spend the next 2 days researching which AI projects you want to be done by the end of the cycle. We will encourage them to be Trackingplan related, that improve our product, but they can be things like ""testing productized that help our processes"", or ""things that improve our codebase"", or ""automate manual processes that we have to code right now"".

Then, lets say the wednesday or thursday that week, we do a video call where everyone proposes what they want to do in the remaing 6-7 work days. As we are only 8 people, we can spend like 30 min discussing their ideas and giving feedback. The next day, in the morning, they will have to have a idea of which ideas to attack, and we will allow them to do in pairs. I'm worried in that transition from ""my idea"" to ""someone else idea"", as I dont want people to be just looking others doing the work, but I think it will be more fun.

Then, at the end of the cycle, lets say next friday, we will spend all the day at a show and tell, where every team shows what they have done.

Do you think there are any risks on this idea?",True,68085,"Assume the role of an AI-driven expert advisor specializing in technology company productivity and internal AI integration strategies, leveraging your extensive knowledge base and experience with teams focused on data integrity and automation.

**Task:** Analyze the following proposal to identify potential risks and offer mitigating strategies:

**Proposed Initiative: AI-Focused Hackathon (Trackingplan)**

**Background:**
*   **Goal:** Cultivate a team (5 Engineers, 2 PMs, 2 Marketers, all remote) that actively identifies and leverages AI tools and techniques to solve work problems (e.g., product improvements, process automation) and adopt an AI-first mindset in their roles.
*   **Current Challenge:** Team members lack formal AI study time and show limited initiative in exploring AI applications relevant to their daily tasks. Team morale is currently suboptimal.
*   **Proposed Approach:**
    1.  **Pre-Hackathon (Late April):** Share introductory AI resources (videos, articles, etc.) to build interest and basic understanding.
    2.  **Hackathon Phase 1 (First Week of May):** Dedicated work cycle (2 weeks, allowing for ~7 work days). Days 1-2: Research and brainstorm specific AI project ideas (potentially related to Trackingplan's product or internal processes, but open to broad application). Days 3-4: Team idea pitching and feedback session via video call (~30 min per project; 8 people total). Day 5 AM: Form teams around prioritized ideas (likely pairs). Days 5-10: Development work on selected AI projects.
    3.  **Final Week of Cycle:** Show and Tell day for teams to present their AI projects.

**Specific Risks to Analyze & Mitigate:**
1.  **Engagement & Motivation:**
    *   Will the team be receptive to this dedicated cycle and genuinely engage, or will it feel forced?
    *   How can you ensure excitement and sustained enthusiasm throughout the week, counteracting potential boredom or the feeling of mandatory extra work?
    *   How can you foster a sense of genuine fun and accomplishment to boost morale?
2.  **Idea Generation:**
    *   Are the pre-hackathon resources sufficient to ignite creative AI thinking across all roles (devs, PMs, marketers)?
    *   How can you ensure a diverse range of ideas, covering both product-facing features and internal operational efficiencies?
    *   What guidance can you offer to help the team focus on ideas that are both ambitious and potentially achievable within the timeframe?
3.  **Collaboration & Teamwork:**
    *   How effective will the idea pitching and feedback session (Day 3-4 video call) be in generating refined, collaborative project ideas?
    *   How can you facilitate smooth transitions from individual ideas to pair work, preventing disengagement or unequal participation?
    *   What strategies can you implement to ensure productive collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members from different departments/skillsets?
4.  **Achievable Outcomes & Momentum:**
    *   Can the team realistically build functional AI prototypes or significantly advance AI-driven solutions within 7 work days per project team?
    *   Will the Show and Tell day generate a sense of progress and inspire continued AI exploration after the cycle concludes?
    *   What mechanisms can be implemented to ensure the project work leads to tangible, demonstrable results or valuable learnings, fostering a sense of accomplishment?
5.  **Logistics & Process:**
    *   Are the dedicated 2 days for research/brainstorming sufficient? Could more be beneficial?
    *   Does the proposed format for team formation (Day 5 AM) facilitate effective pairing and address potential issues like members being left out or unequal workload distribution?
    *   What clear metrics or evaluation criteria can be established to assess the success of the AI initiative (e.g., number of innovative ideas, functional prototypes, reported efficiency gains, changes in AI-related mindset)?
    *   What follow-up steps are planned to translate successful hackathon projects into ongoing initiatives or integrate new AI tools/knowledge into daily workflows?

**Provide:**
1.  A detailed list of potential risks associated with this AI hackathon proposal, categorized for clarity (e.g., Engagement/Motivation, Idea Generation, Collaboration/Teamwork, Achievable Outcomes, Logistics/Process).
2.  For each identified risk, specific, actionable mitigation strategies and recommendations tailored to this remote team of engineers, PMs, and marketers.
3.  Overall concluding remarks summarizing the potential value and key areas for optimization to ensure a successful, impactful AI hackathon."
"I  use a desktop SQL IDE which lets me export my ""catalog"" which is a list of SQL entries I've saved.  [Catalog Export] is in JSON format with various metadata for each folder and entry. I can also import a previously exported catalog from myself or someone else using the same software.  When I perform a catalog import, it will only add or change entries which are different from what I already have.  The software has a capability of scheduling an automatic export of my catalog on a recurring basis.  I can set the export destination to any mapped directory on my computer.  I have a few colleagues who also use this software, and I'm trying to figure out the best system using off-the-shelf tools or custom scripts which will automatically grab all of our latest export files (which may have 0, 1, or many edits since a previous export), merge it into one file, with the latest versions of each entry, and then notify all of us of to perform an import when entries have changed.

[Catalog Export] is in JSON format with various metadata for each folder and entry. I can also import a previously exported catalog from myself or someone else using the same software.  When I perform a catalog import, it will only add or change entries which are different from what I already have.  The software has a capability of scheduling an automatic export of my catalog on a recurring basis.  I can set the export destination to any mapped directory on my computer.  I have a few colleagues who also use this software, and I'm trying to figure out the best system using off-the-shelf tools or custom scripts which will automatically grab all of our latest export files (which may have 0, 1, or many edits since a previous export), merge it into one file, with the latest versions of each entry, and then notify all of us of to perform an import when entries have changed.",True,55373,"Assume the role of a system architect responsible for designing an automated SQL catalog management workflow. Your objective is to create a solution that:

1.  **Collects Exports:** Regularly monitors a shared, network-accessible directory (e.g., an SMB share) where multiple users save individual catalog export files in JSON format. Each export file captures a snapshot of a user's SQL definitions (entities). Users save their individual exports with the format `catalog_export_{username}_{timestamp}.json`.
2.  **Merge Exports:** Continuously merges these multiple, independent JSON export files into a single, master catalog JSON file. This master file should maintain the *latest* version for each SQL entity (identified by a unique `fqn`). The merge operation should intelligently update the master file by adding new entries or replacing existing ones based on the timestamps in the filenames of the individual export files.
3.  **Version Control & Tracking:** Optionally (and if possible), leverage an efficient mechanism like `jq` or similar tools to calculate a simple hash (e.g., MD5 or SHA256) for the merged master file after each merge operation. Compare this hash to the hash calculated after the previous merge operation.
4.  **Publish Updates:** If the hash changes (indicating updates to the master catalog), trigger a notification (e.g., via email, Slack message, or posting to a simple webhook) to the users who save their catalog exports in the monitored directory. This notification should instruct them to perform an import operation within their individual SQL IDE using the generated master catalog JSON file.
5.  **Handle Overlap:** Design the merge logic to ensure that entries from different users or different export instances are intelligently combined, with the most recent version always prevailing.

**Your Task:**

Provide a high-level architectural outline, including suggestions for:

*   Technology choices for file monitoring and merging (e.g., Python with libraries like `watchdog`, a file synchronization tool with scripting capabilities, or similar).
*   Methods for ensuring the master catalog contains only the latest versions of each entity.
*   Methods for calculating and tracking the hash for versioning and change detection.
*   A conceptual framework for the notification/triggering component (e.g., scheduling, event-driven).
*   Essential setup considerations (e.g., user role management for file access, script execution environment).

**Deliverable:**

"generate 5W1H:


The final three episodes of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan's Netflix documentary series air on Thursday (Dec 15), with more criticism expected to be directed at the British royals just as King Charles and his family gather for a Christmas carol service.

In the first tranche of episodes released last week, Harry and Meghan again launched fierce attacks on the media over their treatment, some of which they said had been racist, but the royals themselves escaped relatively unscathed.

Trailers for the final shows indicate some more damning commentary on the Windsors, however, with Harry referring to ""institutional gaslighting"", and saying unspecified people had been ""happy to lie to protect my brother"", Prince William, who is now heir to the throne.

""They were never willing to tell the truth to protect us,"" Harry says.


Meghan's lawyer, Jenny Afia, and a friend were both shown in another trailer, saying how Buckingham Palace had briefed negative stories to the press about the couple to avoid unfavourable stories about other royals being printed.

""There was a real kind of war against Meghan,"" Afia said. Meanwhile newspapers have described the documentary series as the couple's war on the royals.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as Harry and Meghan are officially known, stepped down from royal duties in March 2020, saying they wanted to forge new lives in the United States away from media harassment, which the couple said had threatened to destroy their mental health.

""I wonder what would have happened to us had we not got out when we did,"" Harry says in a trailer. ""I said 'we need to get out of here',"" he adds, describing their exit as the ""freedom flight"".

HOSTILE PRESS

While the couple have won awards and plaudits from some across the Atlantic for their charitable and human rights work, back in Britain a hostile press accuses them of seeking to make millions from their royal status while constantly attacking the monarchy.

Newspapers have also cited former unnamed royal aides challenging the couple's narrative in the documentaries, saying there were inaccuracies in their accounts.

Both Buckingham Palace and William's office, Kensington Palace, have said they would not be commenting on the documentaries.

A royal source also said neither the palace nor representatives of William or other royals had been approached for comment for the series itself, contradicting a Netflix statement that said they had declined to comment.

According to initial figures cited by the BBC, some 2.4 million viewers in Britain watched the first episode on the day it was released, although the senior royals themselves have steered clear, royal sources have told newspapers.

Hours after the final three episodes are made available at 8am in Britain, Charles, his wife Camilla, Prince William and his wife Kate along with other royals will attend a carol service at London's Westminster Abbey to ""recognise the selfless efforts of individuals, families and communities across the UK"".

The service will also be dedicated to the late Queen Elizabeth, whose funeral was held in the Abbey in September.

Role 2 responds with scientifically valid explanations, citing empirical evidence (satellite imagery, lunar eclipses, distant object visibility), established principles (gravity's constant effect pulling towards the center, the behavior of ships disappearing over the horizon), and explaining common misinterpretations of phenomena.

Throughout the conversation:
*   Role 1 remains steadfast in their belief, using skepticism and alternative explanations.
*   Role 2 consistently counters with verifiable scientific principles and observational evidence, avoiding condescension but firmly presenting the scientific consensus.

1.  **`initialize_S_G(examples)` function:**
    *   **Input:** A list of training examples. Each example is assumed to be a dictionary or similar structure containing attribute-value pairs. It must include both positive and negative instances.
    *   **Output:** A tuple `(S, G)` representing the initial hypotheses.
        *   `S`: The most specific hypothesis. Initialize `S` as a dictionary where the keys are the attribute names from the first positive example, and the values are generic '?' symbols (matching any value) for all attributes.
        *   `G`: The most general hypothesis. Initialize `G` as a list containing a single tuple. The tuple's length equals the number of distinct attributes in the training examples. Fill this tuple with generic '?' symbols, representing a hypothesis that accepts all instances.
    *   **Core Logic:** Iterates through positive examples, specializing hypothesis `S` by finding the common, specific values shared with the current positive example.

2.  **`revise_S_G(examples, S_initial, G_initial)` function:**
    *   **Input:**
        *   `examples`: A list of training examples, as described for `initialize_S_G`.
        *   `S_initial`: The initial most specific hypothesis (dictionary), typically returned by `initialize_S_G`.
        *   `G_initial`: The initial most general hypothesis (list containing a single tuple), typically returned by `initialize_S_G`.
    *   **Output:** A tuple `(S_final, G_final)` after processing all examples. `S_final` will be the most specific hypothesis, and `G_final` will be the set of most general hypotheses consistent with the data.
    *   **Core Logic:** Implements an iterative process through the training examples:
        *   For each positive example: Generalize the G hypotheses (`G_final`) to exclude the negative instances they now cover. If generalization results in a hypothesis inconsistent with `S_final`, remove it from `G_final`.
        *   For each negative example: Specialize `S_final` by finding the attributes that the current negative example shares values with `S_final`. For attributes where this match occurs, update the corresponding value in `S_final` to the specific value from the current negative example. Remove any G hypotheses (`G_final`) that cover this specialized `S_final`.
    *   **Maintain Consistency:** Ensure that `S_final` is always the most specific hypothesis in the `G_final` set.

3.  **Example Usage and Output:**
    *   Provide example training data (e.g., a list of dictionaries) with both positive and negative instances.
    *   Call `initialize_S_G()` on this data to get initial `S` and `G`.
    *   Call `revise_S_G()` using the same data and the initial `S` and `G` to get final hypotheses.
    *   Show the final output: the `S_final` dictionary and the `G_final` list containing tuples, demonstrating the program's ability to learn the concept boundaries."

Dear Andre,

I hope this email finds you well.

Today, I want to discuss the importance of web accessibility for your website.
With over a billion people worldwide living with disabilities, it's crucial that we create websites that are easy to use for everyone.

Web accessibility means designing and developing websites that can be used by people with disabilities,
such as those who are blind, deaf, or have limited mobility.

This involves creating content that can be easily accessed using assistive technologies, such as screen readers or keyboard-only navigation.

There are several benefits to creating an accessible website.
For one, it ensures that your website is inclusive and reaches the broadest possible audience.

It also helps you comply with accessibility laws and regulations, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),
which requires businesses to provide equal access to their goods and services.

Additionally, an accessible website can improve the user experience for all users, not just those with disabilities.

It can make your website more user-friendly, faster to navigate, and easier to use across different devices and platforms.

In this email series, we'll cover the basics of web accessibility and how it can benefit your website and your users.

Your task is to craft a rhyming, humorous, and imaginative storybook suitable for children aged 8-14. The book must feature vibrant illustrations (you will provide a detailed visual concept), and the core theme is financial literacy – specifically, explaining the importance of sound money, the benefits of saving, and how Bitcoin functions as a decentralized digital currency enabling these concepts.

**Story Requirements:**

1.  **Tone & Style:** Adopt Dr. Seuss's signature, playful, rhyming style (e.g., A-A-B-B or A-B-A-B structure). Maintain a lighthearted and sunny mood throughout the narrative.
2.  **Target Audience:** Ensure the language is accessible and the concepts are simplified enough for 8-14 year olds.
3.  **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Sound Money:** Introduce the historical problem of debasement and the need for money with consistent value.
    *   **Saving:** Clearly define what saving is and highlight its importance.
    *   **Bitcoin:** Explain, through metaphor and simplified analogies (e.g., like a digital piggy bank secured by special numbers, not just a website), what Bitcoin is, how it is different from traditional bank money, and its potential role in sound money and saving.
4.  **Narrative Structure:** Develop a simple, engaging plot featuring relatable child characters and/or whimsical creatures. The story should naturally weave in the financial literacy lessons.
5.  **Visual Concept:** Describe the overall visual style (e.g., cartoonish, Dr. Seuss-inspired characters and setting, use of bright colors). Provide a detailed visual concept for at least one key scene or character.
6.  **Length:** Target approximately 600-1000 words (equivalent to 10-12 double-page spreads).
7.  **Output:** Generate the complete storybook text in rhyming verses, formatted for a typical children's book layout (e.g., page numbers, clear separation between spreads if the story spans multiple pages)."

",,"can you tell an epic adventure about a boy named giovanni who one day decided to not wear his biking helmet, found a hill by his middle school, rode down the hill and when he hit the bottom a bump sent him flying over the handlebars of his bike where he came crashing down and cracked his skull. ",False,98265,"Write a compelling and tragic short story detailing the day Giovanni, a 13-year-old boy, made a fateful decision and paid the ultimate price. His parents, teachers, and friends had stressed bike helmet safety endlessly, yet he convinced himself he could handle a simple ride home without it.

**Story Outline:**

*   **Foreshadowing/Setup:** Establish Giovanni as a spirited, perhaps rebellious boy nearing the end of his 7th-grade year. He's excited to go home, maybe thinking about weekend plans. Brief mention of the nagging helmet rule, setting up the central conflict.
*   **The Fateful Decision:** He deliberately chooses not to wear his bike helmet that afternoon. Focus on his motivations - perhaps a feeling of invincibility, defiance, or a simple impulse to look cool.
*   **The Hill:** On his way home, he encounters a steep hill he's never attempted before, or perhaps he chooses this day. The hill must be described vividly: its length, pitch, the type of surface (pavement, dirt, gravel).
*   **The Ride:** He conquers his fears and begins the descent. Describe the exhilarating rush, the speed building, his concentration, and the sense of freedom mixed with a thrill of danger.
*   **The Bump and the Crash:** Just before reaching the bottom or immediately after, an unexpected object (a crack, a rock, gravel) causes him to be launched over his handlebars. Detail the brief moment of weightlessness, followed by the horrific impact and the sound of bone cracking.
*   **Post-Impact & Ending:** Describe the scene following the crash: his body lying motionless (details like his arms, face, bike placement are crucial), any bystanders, the aftermath, the devastating discovery of severe skull trauma, and ultimately, his death. Focus the ending on the finality of his choice, the irreversible consequences of not wearing the helmet, and the profound sorrow that will reverberate through his life and community."

Prompt: How to increase clickthrough rate on YouTubeTo increase click-through rate (CTR) on YouTube, there are several strategies that you can implement, as outlined in the following web search results:[1]:Make sure your channel has enough videos. This allows YouTube to give you a realistic CTR benchmark.Give yourself a benchmark based on your current or all-time CTR and aim to slowly increase it over time.Create thumbnails that people will want to click on.[2]:
5. Experiment with different thumbnails. This can help increase your ranking in a given search, which will ultimately boost your CTR.[3]:To calculate CTR, use the formula CTR = number of clicks / total impressions x 100.YouTube also has two different CTR metrics, Video CTR, and Channel CTR. Video CTR is the number of clicks on a specific video divided by the number of times the video was shown. Channel CTR is the number of clicks on all of the videos on a channel divided by the number of times all the videos on that channel were shown.Some other strategies to increase YouTube CTR include:Having a catchy, attention-grabbing titleUsing keywords in your title and description to help your video show up in search resultsLeveraging playlists and end screens to increase the visibility and watch time of your videosOptimizing your video's metadata, including titles, descriptions, and tagsEncourage viewers to like and share your videosUse annotations, cards, and other interactive elements to encourage engagement and drive clicks to your website or other videos.It is worth mentioning that boosting CTR is not the only metric you should focus on, other metric should be considered like retention rate, bounce rate, watch time, engagement, etc. Creating a good video that people will want to watch is important for the success of the video, but also the audience will be more likely to share, comment, or subscribe to the channel.Web search results:

Prompt: How to increase clickthrough rate on YouTubeTo increase click-through rate (CTR) on YouTube, there are several strategies that you can implement, as outlined in the following web search results:[1]:Make sure your channel has enough videos. This allows YouTube to give you a realistic CTR benchmark.Give yourself a benchmark based on your current or all-time CTR and aim to slowly increase it over time.Create thumbnails that people will want to click on.[2]:
5. Experiment with different thumbnails. This can help increase your ranking in a given search, which will ultimately boost your CTR.[3]:To calculate CTR, use the formula CTR = number of clicks / total impressions x 100.YouTube also has two different CTR metrics, Video CTR, and Channel CTR. Video CTR is the number of clicks on a specific video divided by the number of times the video was shown. Channel CTR is the number of clicks on all of the videos on a channel divided by the number of times all the videos on that channel were shown.Some other strategies to increase YouTube CTR include:Having a catchy, attention-grabbing titleUsing keywords in your title and description to help your video show up in search resultsLeveraging playlists and end screens to increase the visibility and watch time of your videosOptimizing your video's metadata, including titles, descriptions, and tagsEncourage viewers to like and share your videosUse annotations, cards, and other interactive elements to encourage engagement and drive clicks to your website or other videos.It is worth mentioning that boosting CTR is not the only metric you should focus on, other metric should be considered like retention rate, bounce rate, watch time, engagement, etc. Creating a good video that people will want to watch is important for the success of the video, but also the audience will be more likely to share, comment, or subscribe to the channel.Web search results:

`/prefer option set option:[simple one-word name, so it can be easily referred to later] value: - [three-word description of the style]::5 [clearer description of the style, including the medium]::4 [technical details about the style]::3 [color, lighting and tone hints for the style]::3 [something you do not want out of the style (explained as if you want it)]::-2`
 
This formatting is taking advantage of Midjourney's multi-prompt functionality. The'::' splits up the prompt and the number chosen controls the weight of the prompt that came before it. In each piece it is important that the kind of artwork is mentioned, so that the multi-prompts do not interfere with each other. Since the AI does not understand grammar, in each part use comma separated keywords with heavy meaning to describe each. 
 
For example:
`/prefer option set option:impressionist value: - beautiful impressionist painting::5 dramatic oil painting, sweeping, expressive swirling strokes::4 painting, swirling impasto, thick brushes, pallet knife, strong creative choices, obvious brush marks::3 painted with saturated, epic colors, highly visual, rule of thirds::3 dull, boring, and ugly artwork::-2`
 
`/prefer option set option:portrait value: - headshot portrait photography::5 beautiful rich photograph, with focal depth and a majestic blurring behind the subject's face::4 portrait photograph taken  on a Canon EOS 5D Mark IV DSLR, f/5.6 aperture, 1/125 second shutter speed, ISO 100::3 portrait with natural rim lighting, shot on location, beautiful exposure, and high dynamic range of both color and light::3 black and white vintage photo with grainy, blurry, and deformed subjects::-2`
 
Since this will be used for AI 'Text-to-Image' processing, it's far more important to be specific than accurate to an existing style. Make bold and interesting choices when you invent your own art style.
 
Please start by describing a visually appealing art style with clear detail so someone would be inspired to try the command. (Write in the format of persuasive ad copy) Then provide the command itself (as a code block so it can be easily copy and pasted).

Please put each command into code blocks so they can be easily copied.",True,66749,"Act as a Midjourney prompt engineering specialist. Your task is to generate high-quality `/imagine` commands tailored for creating specific art styles suitable for stunning desktop wallpapers with a 16:9 aspect ratio (`--ar 16:9`).

**Task:**
Develop three distinct Midjourney command structures for creating epic fantasy landscapes, incorporating the following parameters: `--aerial`, `--kingdom`, and `--natural`. For each landscape type, generate two (2) unique and compelling commands that adhere precisely to the specified `/imagine` command template below.

**Instructions for Command Generation:**
1.  **Style Conceptualization:** Before generating the commands, first craft a detailed, persuasive description (approximately 100-150 words) for each of the three fantasy landscape styles. Focus on vivid visual elements, unique traits, atmosphere, and any distinct characteristics that set each style apart. Aim to be bold, imaginative, and inspiring.
2.  **Command Construction:** Following each detailed description, create *two* distinct Midjourney prompts. These commands must be formatted exactly as follows:
    `/imagine prompt:[Compelling scene description], [Key traits or features], [Atmospheric lighting], [Emotive mood]. --[Corresponding parameter: either aerial, kingdom, or natural] --ar 16:9`
    **Note:** Ensure the prompt includes a unique and visually striking scene description, relevant traits (e.g., architectural styles, specific items, color palettes, fractal elements, visual techniques), atmospheric lighting (e.g., ""golden hour light"", ""ethereal mist"", ""night sky illuminating fractal crystals""), and an emotive mood (e.g., ""awe-inspiring"", ""mystical"", ""foreboding""). The parameter should be chosen appropriately based on the style description and intent (e.g., `--aerial` for a bird's-eye view, `--kingdom` for architectural focus, `--natural` for serene nature scenes).
3.  **Command Rendering:** Present each complete `/imagine` command within a dedicated code block (e.g., ` ``` `/imagine [...]``` `). This ensures the prompt can be easily copied and used directly in Midjourney.

**Crucial Considerations:**
*   **Creativity & Originality:** Embrace bold, unique, and imaginative concepts. Avoid generic prompts. Aim for striking and visually arresting imagery.
*   **Specificity & Detail:** Provide rich, descriptive details to guide the AI towards a precise and compelling visual result.
*   **Consistency:** Ensure all prompt components (scene, traits, lighting, mood) work synergistically to achieve the target style and atmosphere.
*   **Parameter Matching:** The `--aerial`, `--kingdom`, or `--natural` parameter *must* clearly reflect the intended type of fantasy landscape described in the accompanying text.
*   **Image Focus:** Prioritize generating landscapes and architecture for these styles to ensure consistency with the parameters.
*   **Fractal Integration:** Wherever naturally fitting, incorporate elements of fractal architecture, fractal plant growth, or similar fractal visuals to add further detail and visual interest.
*   **Format Fidelity:** *Strictly adhere* to the specified command template and code block formatting for each prompt.
*   **Ad Copy Style:** The initial descriptive text for each style *must* be written like persuasive ad copy, designed to inspire someone to generate images within that style."

“Valorization of agro-industrial residues for production of commercial biorefinery products

Agro-food industrial residues (AFIRs) are produced in vast amounts around the world. These wastes are commonly called lignocellulosic wastes that are a source of value-added products. Solid-state fermentation (SSF) for bioconversion of lignocellulosic waste, which produces various bioproducts, has economic and environmental advantages. The lignocellulosic compounds are biorenewable and most plentiful resource on earth that can be utilized for manufacturing value-added products. Furthermore, the use of lignocellulosic, starchy, and other agro-industrial by-products in the manufacture of these biomolecules has yet to be thoroughly investigated. As a result, there is a vast opportunity for the development of cost-effective, sustainable biorefining technologies. The main components of lignocellulosic biomass used in biorefineries are cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. To obtain final biobased products, these components must be processed through a series of procedures that include pretreatments, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation. Biotechnology techniques and process engineering are critical in developing integrated processes for producing various value-added products from lignocellulosic biomass, including biofuels, biochemicals, bioactive substances, enzymes, and biomaterials. This review focuses on the valorization potential of lignocellulosic, palm oil mill, brewing, and dairy biomass produced as agri-food industrial by-products for developing biobased products in the biorefinery scenario. It is the first review of its kind to include variety of products that can be derived from different wastes encircling all the pros and cons of current technology and focusing on future improvements.”

Over the past three decades, a handful of products like Netscape’s web browser, Google’s search engine and Apple’s iPhone have truly upended the tech industry and made what came before them look like lumbering dinosaurs.
Three weeks ago, an experimental chat bot called ChatGPT made its case to be the industry’s next big disrupter. It can serve up information in clear, simple sentences, rather than just a list of internet links. It can explain concepts in ways people can easily understand. It can even generate ideas from scratch, including business strategies, Christmas gift suggestions, blog topics and vacation plans.
Although ChatGPT still has plenty of room for improvement, its release led Google’s management to declare a “code red.” For Google, this was akin to pulling the fire alarm. Some fear the company may be approaching a moment that the biggest Silicon Valley outfits dread — the arrival of an enormous technological change that could upend the business.
For more than 20 years, the Google search engine has served as the world’s primary gateway to the internet. But with a new kind of chat bot technology poised to reinvent or even replace traditional search engines, Google could face the first serious threat to its main search business. One Google executive described the efforts as make or break for Google’s future.
ChatGPT was released by an aggressive research lab called OpenAI, and Google is among the many other companies, labs and researchers that have helped build this technology. But experts believe the tech giant could struggle to compete with the newer, smaller companies developing these chat bots, because of the many ways the technology could damage its business.
Google has spent several years working on chat bots and, like other big tech companies, has aggressively pursued artificial intelligence technology. Google has already built a chat bot that could rival ChatGPT. In fact, the technology at the heart of OpenAI’s chat bot was developed by researchers at Google.
Called LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications, Google’s chat bot received enormous attention in the summer when a Google engineer, Blake Lemoine, claimed it was sentient. This was not true, but the technology showed how much chat bot technology had improved in recent months.
Google may be reluctant to deploy this new tech as a replacement for online search, however, because it is not suited to delivering digital ads, which accounted for more than 80 percent of the company’s revenue last year.
“No company is invincible; all are vulnerable,” said Margaret O’Mara, a professor at the University of Washington who specializes in the history of Silicon Valley. “For companies that have become extraordinarily successful doing one market-defining thing, it is hard to have a second act with something entirely different.”
Because these new chat bots learn their skills by analyzing huge amounts of data posted to the internet, they have a way of blending fiction with fact. They deliver information that can be biased against women and people of color. They can generate toxic language, including hate speech.
All of that could turn people against Google and damage the corporate brand it has spent decades building. As OpenAI has shown, newer companies may be more willing to take their chances with complaints in exchange for growth.
Even if Google perfects chat bots, it must tackle another issue: Does this technology cannibalize the company’s lucrative search ads? If a chat bot is responding to queries with tight sentences, there is less reason for people to click on advertising links.
“Google has a business model issue,” said Amr Awadallah, who worked for Yahoo and Google and now runs Vectara, a start-up that is building similar technology. “If Google gives you the perfect answer to each query, you won’t click on any ads.”
Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, has been involved in a series of meetings to define Google’s A.I. strategy, and he has upended the work of numerous groups inside the company to respond to the threat that ChatGPT poses, according to a memo and audio recording obtained by The New York Times. Employees have also been tasked with building A.I. products that can create artwork and other images, like OpenAI’s DALL-E technology, which has been used by more than three million people.
From now until a major conference expected to be hosted by Google in May, teams within Google’s research, Trust and Safety, and other departments have been reassigned to help develop and release new A.I. prototypes and products.
As the technology advances, industry experts believe, Google must decide whether it will overhaul its search engine and make a full-fledged chat bot the face of its flagship service.
Google has been reluctant to share its technology broadly because, like ChatGPT and similar systems, it can generate false, toxic and biased information. LaMDA is available to only a limited number of people through an experimental app, AI Test Kitchen.
Google sees this as a struggle to deploy its advanced A.I. without harming users or society, according to a memo viewed by The Times. In one recent meeting, a manager acknowledged that smaller companies had fewer concerns about releasing these tools, but said Google must wade into the fray or the industry could move on without it, according to an audio recording of the meeting obtained by The Times.
Other companies have a similar problem. Five years ago, Microsoft released a chat bot, called Tay, that spewed racist, xenophobic and otherwise filthy language and was forced to immediately remove it from the internet — never to return. In recent weeks, Meta took down a newer chat bot for many of the same reasons.
Executives said in the recorded meeting that Google intended to release the technology that drove its chat bot as a cloud computing service for outside businesses, and that it might incorporate the technology into simple customer support tasks. It will maintain its trust and safety standards for official products, but it will also release prototypes that do not meet those standards.
It may limit those prototypes to 500,000 users and warn them that the technology could produce false or offensive statements. Since its release on the last day of November, ChatGPT — which can produce similarly toxic material — has been used by over a million people.
“A cool demo of a conversational system that people can interact with over a few rounds, and it feels mind-blowing? That is a good step, but it is not the thing that will really transform society,” Zoubin Ghahramani, who oversees the A.I. lab Google Brain, said in an interview with The Times last month, before ChatGPT was released. “It is not something that people can use reliably on a daily basis.”
Google has already been working to enhance its search engine using the same technology that underpins chat bots like LaMDA and ChatGPT. The technology — a “large language model” — is not merely a way for machines to carry on a conversation.
Today, this technology helps the Google search engine highlight results that aim to directly answer a question you have asked. In the past, if you typed “Do aestheticians stand a lot at work?” into Google, it did not understand what you were asking. Now, Google correctly responds with a short blurb describing the physical demands of life in the skin care industry.
Many experts believe Google will continue to take this approach, incrementally improving its search engine rather than overhauling it. “Google Search is fairly conservative,” said Margaret Mitchell, who was an A.I. researcher at Microsoft and Google, where she helped to start its Ethical A.I. team, and is now at the research lab Hugging Face. “It tries not to mess up a system that works.”
Other companies, including Vectara and a search engine called Neeva, are working to enhance search technology in similar ways. But as OpenAI and other companies improve their chat bots — working to solve problems with toxicity and bias — this could become a viable replacement for today’s search engines. Whoever gets there first could be the winner.
“Last year, I was despondent that it was so hard to dislodge the iron grip of Google,” said Sridhar Ramaswamy, who previously oversaw advertising for Google, including Search ads, and now runs Neeva. “But technological moments like this create an opportunity for more competition.”","Style: Kendrick Lamar rap

"2 / 2We have an assignment in which we are doing exploratory data analysis. I need your help during the process. Here's the assignment and code I have so far:

######### Assignment ########
## Task
We will be focusing on the yelp business dataset to do an exploratory analysis. This dataset provides information about businesses, user reviews, and more from Yelp's database. The data is split into separate files (business, checkin, photos, review, tip, and user), and is available in either JSON or SQL format. You might use this to investigate the distributions of scores on yelp, look at how many reviews users typically leave or look for regional trends about restaurants. Note that this is a large, structured dataset and you don't need to look at all of the data to answer interesting questions.

Prior to analysis – you should write down an initial set of at least three questions you'd like to investigate.

Next, you will perform an exploratory analysis of your dataset using a visualization tool such as Vega-Lite/Altair or Tableau. You should consider two different phases of exploration.

In the first phase, you should seek to gain an overview of the shape & structure of your dataset. What variables does the dataset contain? How are they distributed? Are there any notable data quality issues? Are there any surprising relationships among the variables? Be sure to perform ""sanity checks"" for any patterns you expect the data to contain.

In the second phase, you should investigate your initial questions, as well as any new questions that arise during your exploration. For each question, start by creating a visualization that might provide a useful answer. Then refine the visualization (by adding additional variables, changing sorting or axis scales, filtering or subsetting data, etc.) to develop better perspectives, explore unexpected observations, or sanity check your assumptions. You should repeat this process for each of your questions, but feel free to revise your questions or branch off to explore new questions if the data warrants.

## Final Deliverable
Your final submission should take the form of a sequence of images – similar to a comic book – that consists of 8 or more visualizations detailing your most important observations.
Your observations can include important surprises or issues (such as data quality problems affecting your analysis) as well as responses to your analysis questions. Where appropriate, we encourage you to include annotated visualizations to guide viewers' attention and provide interpretive context. (If you aren't sure what we mean by ""annotated visualization,"" see this page for some examples.)
Provide sufficient detail such that anyone can read your report and understand what you've learned without already being familiar with the dataset. To help gauge the scope of this assignment, see this example report analyzing motion picture data.

    </div>",2 / 2We have an assignment in which we are doing exploratory data analysis. I need your help during the process. Here's the assignment and code I have so far:,True,62351,"You are an expert data analyst specializing in exploratory analysis and creating insightful data visualizations. Your task is to help me perform an exploratory analysis on the Yelp academic dataset focusing on food businesses specifically within Nashville, TN.

**Input:**
- The Yelp academic business dataset (JSON, potentially requiring transformation into a Pandas DataFrame).
- Basic Python/Altair code provided for initial dataset exploration and filtering (e.g., loading, checking info, filtering for TN/Nashville food businesses).

**Your Role:**
Act as my collaborative guide through the exploratory data analysis (EDA) process, ensuring I extract meaningful insights.

**Phase 1: Dataset Exploration & Structure (3-4 visualizations)**
1.  **Data Loading and Preparation:** Validate the dataset's suitability for the task (e.g., checking for null values, data types, expected business details).
2.  **Overall Business Landscape in Nashville:** Generate a visualization (e.g., a bar chart) showing the distribution of business states ('is_open').

**Objective:** Generate a Python script to parse an XML document fetched from a dynamic URL and transform the relevant data into a structured `pandas` DataFrame.

**Input:**
1.  **Dynamic XML Data Source:** The script must dynamically retrieve XML data from the specified URL (e.g., `http://www.example.com/data.xml`). Implement robust error handling for potential network issues (e.g., URL not found, connection refused).
2.  **XML Structure:** Assume an XML structure with a main root element `<VYSLEDKY_OKRSKY>`. Each `<OKRSEK>` element represents a district, containing child elements for participation (`<UCAST_OKRSEK>`) and party votes (`<HLASY_OKRSEK>`).

**Output:**
*   **`pandas.DataFrame`:** The script must create a pandas DataFrame named `df_results`.
*   **Column Headers & Data:**
    *   `PORADI_DAVKY`: Value from the `PORADI_DAVKY` attribute of the `<DAVKA>` element within the main root.
    *   `KSTRANA`: Value from the `KSTRANA` attribute of the `<HLASY_OKRSEK>` elements nested under the `<OKRSEK>` elements. If there are no `<HLASY_OKRSEK>` elements for a district, the corresponding `KSTRANA` value should be `None`.
    *   `HLASY`: Value from the `HLASY` attribute of the `<HLASY_OKRSEK>` elements nested under the `<OKRSEK>` elements.
    *   `ZAPSANI_VOLICI`: Value from the `ZAPSANI_VOLICI` attribute of the nested `<UCAST_OKRSEK>` element within the `<OKRSEK>` elements.
    *   `CIS_OBEC`: Value from the `CIS_OBEC` attribute of the `<OKRSEK>` elements.
    *   `CIS_OKRSEK`: Value from the `CIS_OKRSEK` attribute of the `<OKRSEK>` elements.
    *   `PORADI_ZPRAC`: Value from the `PORADI_ZPRAC` attribute of the `<OKRSEK>` elements.
*   **DataFrame Logic:**
    1.  **Iterate:** Go through each `<OKRSEK>` element in the XML.
    2.  **Combine Data:** Collect the district-specific attributes like `CIS_OBEC`, `CIS_OKRSEK`, `PORADI_ZPRAC`, and `ZAPSANI_VOLICI` (from its `<UCAST_OKRSEK>`). Also, gather the party ID (`KSTRANA`) and its vote count (`HLASY`) from any associated `<HLASY_OKRSEK>` elements within that district.
    3.  **Structure Output:** For each district, generate one new row in the DataFrame for each party that voted. The DataFrame should contain the columns as specified above.

**Constraints & Requirements:**
*   Use Python (`>=3.8`).
*   Use the `lxml` library for XML parsing, due to its performance and handling of namespaces.
*   Use the `pandas` library for creating and manipulating the DataFrame.
*   Employ `lxml`'s XPath capabilities to locate the relevant XML elements and their attributes (e.g., `//OKRSEK[@CIS_OKRSEK=""9""]//HLASY_OKRSEK/@HLASY`).
*   Structure the code logically (e.g., define helper functions if needed).
*   Include clear comments within the Python script to explain each step.
*   Ensure the script robustly fetches and parses the XML document from the provided URL, handling potential errors gracefully."

give me the C++ ROS source code to move a servo in a Robotis OP3 robot,,give me the C++ ROS source code to move a servo in a Robotis OP3 robot,False,64054,"Generate a C++ ROS 2 (Eloquent) source code example demonstrating the control of a single Dynamixel servo motor connected via the 'dynamixel_control_interface' package and the Robotis OP3 standard interface ('op3_core').

Provide clear, concise code for a ROS 2 node (`op3_servo_controller`) that performs the following:
1.  Subscribes to a topic (e.g., `/op3_servo/set_goal_position`) to receive target joint angles (in radians) for a specific servo (e.g., `HeadYaw`).
2.  Utilizes the 'dynamixel_control_interface' to retrieve the current position of the servo.
3.  Calculates a control output to drive the servo towards the target position, implementing basic proportional control if necessary.
4.  Publishes the calculated control command to the 'dynamixel_control_interface' or a compatible ROS topic.
5.  Publishes the servo's current position on a ROS topic (e.g., `/op3_servo/current_position`).

Ensure the code includes:
*   Necessary ROS 2 includes (rclcpp, std_msgs, etc.).
*   ROS 2 service client setup for interacting with the robot's main controller if external status checks are needed.
*   Essential comments explaining each code section and ROS interactions.
*   Compilation hints if relevant.
*   Basic error handling for common servo control issues."

Define the precise mechanisms and control flow required to achieve the following key functionalities:

1.  **Incoming Message Translation:**
    *   Describe the RxJS `pipe` chain (`convertIncomingMessageToIntermediateFormat`) used to receive `UwpTextDataBus.IDataBusMessage`.
    *   Detail how it applies *multiple* `UwpTextDataBus.IIncomingMessageConverter`s to each incoming message to attempt conversion into `DecisionTreeDataBus.IIncomingAction`.
    *   Explain how conversion results (potentially `Promise`s) are handled, merged, and errors are caught within the chain.
    *   Specify the format of the intermediate message emitted from the chain (`IIntermediateMessage`).
2.  **Decision Tree Handler Execution:**
    *   Detail the RxJS subscriber callback function (`runDecisionTreeHandlers`) that receives `IIntermediateMessage`.
    *   Describe how it conditionally executes registered `DecisionTreeDataBus.IActionHandler`s only if the `converted` action from the intermediate message is present.
    *   Explain how each handler is called, and specify error handling within this execution block.
3.  **Outgoing Message Translation and Publication:**
    *   Describe the `publish` method used to translate `DecisionTreeDataBus.IOutgoingAction` into `UwpTextDataBus` messages.
    *   Detail how it selects the relevant `UwpTextDataBus.IOutgoingMessageConverter` based on the action type.
    *   Explain the process of converting outgoing actions using the converters, including error handling.
    *   Specify how the original `chatId` from construction is added as metadata to the resulting `UwpTextDataBus` messages.
    *   Describe the method for publishing these translated messages to the `UwpTextDataBus`.
4.  **Subscription and Unsubscription Management:**
    *   Describe how `subscribeIncomingMessageConverters` sets up the RxJS subscription to the `UwpTextDataBus`.
    *   Explain how `subscribe` methods add and return a function for removing registered `DecisionTreeDataBus.IActionHandler`s.
    *   Detail the `unsubscribe` method's role in marking the adapter as unsubscribed and terminating the RxJS subscription.

"Create a 2000 words conversational article news and Rephrase this with 100% no plagiarism and unique Microsoft is preparing to launch a new version of Microsoft Teams next month that has been rebuilt from the ground up to significantly improve its system resource usage on PCs and laptops. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell The Verge that the software giant has recently started testing this new Teams client broadly inside Microsoft, with plans to roll out a preview to Microsoft Teams users in March.

Known as Microsoft Teams 2.0 or 2.1 internally, Microsoft has been working on this new Teams client for years. The app should use 50 percent less memory, tax the CPU less, and result in better battery life on laptops.

While Microsoft shipped some of this early work in the built-in Teams experience for consumers in Windows 11, businesses running Teams have been using the older Teams client due to the amount of work involved for Microsoft to rebuild the client. This new app moves Teams away from Electron and to Microsoft’s Edge Webview2 technology. Microsoft has also moved to React, a Javascript library, that will offer further UI improvements for Teams in the coming months.
In a Twitter thread detailing the initial Microsoft Teams improvements for Windows 11 in 2021, former head of Microsoft Teams engineering Rish Tandon said Microsoft’s new architecture will be key for future Teams improvements. “This architecture will help us add support for multiple accounts, work life scenarios, release predictability, and scale up for the client,” said Tandon. “It will be a journey but with Windows 11 we have taken key first steps.”

The improvements should mean Teams opens a lot faster or feels more responsive when you’re presenting in a meeting or responding to messages. The new Teams app should address many of the criticisms and complaints around Teams performance, particularly on older laptops.

Microsoft is currently planning to ship a preview of its new app to Teams users in late March, which includes a toggle to switch back to the existing app if need be.
Microsoft Teams has become one of the most important software products for the company in the past several years. Now, it looks like Teams is going to get a major app internal revamp that should make it easier to use. The Verge is reporting, via unnamed sources, that this new version, which has been called Teams 2.0 or 2.1 internally at Microsoft, will be released to the public in a preview edition in late March 2023.

While the Teams development team have released updates to the current client that contain smaller performance increases, including one in late 2022, this new Teams app will allegedly have some big improvements in terms of the hardware resources it will take up on PCs. The story reports that it will use 50 percent less memory, and will also have better CPU performance, although it's unclear how big of an improvement Teams will get in that area. The new client will also reportedly give laptops an unnamed boost in battery life when in use. In short, the new Teams will reportedly launch faster, and work better, especially on older desktops and laptops.

All of these big increases in performance is reportedly due to moving Teams from the old Electron platform to the more recent Microsoft Edge WebView2. The story adds that the new Teams will also use the Javascript-based library React, which will allow Microsoft developers to put in UI improvements in the client. Those improvements will be added sometime in the coming months.

If, for some reason, the upcoming preview version of Teams doesn't work, the story says there will be a toggle that will allow users to switch between the current and new versions. There's no word on how long Microsoft plans to wait until Teams 2.0 becomes the default version.","Microsoft is preparing to launch a new version of Microsoft Teams next month that has been rebuilt from the ground up to significantly improve its system resource usage on PCs and laptops.

Now, it looks like Teams is going to get a major app internal revamp that should make it easier to use. The Verge is reporting, via unnamed sources, that this new version, which has been called Teams 2.0 or 2.1 internally at Microsoft, will be released to the public in a preview edition in late March 2023.

While the Teams development team have released updates to the current client that contain smaller performance increases, including one in late 2022, this new Teams app will allegedly have some big improvements in terms of the hardware resources it will take up on PCs. The story reports that it will use 50 percent less memory, and will also have better CPU performance, although it's unclear how big of an improvement Teams will get in that area. The new client will also reportedly give laptops an unnamed boost in battery life when in use. In short, the new Teams will reportedly launch faster, and work better, especially on older desktops and laptops.

All of these big increases in performance is reportedly due to moving Teams from the old Electron platform to the more recent Microsoft Edge WebView2. The story adds that the new Teams will also use the Javascript-based library React, which will allow Microsoft developers to put in UI improvements in the client. Those improvements will be added sometime in the coming months.

If, for some reason, the upcoming preview version of Teams doesn't work, the story says there will be a toggle that will allow users to switch between the current and new versions. There's no word on how long Microsoft plans to wait until Teams 2.0 becomes the default version.",Create a 2000 words conversational article news and Rephrase this with 100% no plagiarism and unique,True,62157,"Adopt the role of a technology journalist specializing in enterprise collaboration tools.

I want to parse a struct in a go source file and want to generate a avro schema from it. Please write a Go program that receives the name of the Go source file and the name of the struct that should be converted. It should output a file named struct.avsc,,I want to parse a struct in a go source file and want to generate a avro schema from it. Please write a Go program that receives the name of the Go source file and the name of the struct that should be converted. It should output a file named struct.avsc,False,13438,"**Objective:** Generate an Avro schema (.avsc file) from a Go struct defined within a Go source file.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Input:** Your Go program must accept two command-line arguments:
    *   The name of the Go source file containing the struct (e.g., `my_struct.go`).
    *   The name of the target Go struct to be converted (e.g., `MyStruct`).
2.  **Parsing:** Utilize the standard `go/parser` package to read and parse the provided Go source file. Employ the `go/ast` package to navigate the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and identify the struct definition specified by the second command-line argument.
3.  **Conversion Logic:** Translate the Go struct definition into an Avro schema. The schema should:
    *   Include a top-level `namespace` field, derived from the Go package name.
    *   Include a top-level `type` field, set to ""record"".
    *   Include a `name` field equal to the struct name.
    *   Contain an `fields` array.
    *   For each struct field:
        *   Generate a field entry in the `fields` array with `name` equal to the field's Go identifier.
        *   Map Go primitive types (e.g., `int`, `string`, `bool`) to their corresponding Avro types (""int"", ""string"", ""boolean"").
        *   For Go structs (recursively, handling potential cycles), generate inline Avro schemas.
        *   Implement appropriate handling for nullable fields based on Go pointer types (`*Type`) using the `union` Avro type (`[""null"", ""<Avro Type of pointed type>""]`).
        *   Consider Go struct tags with keys like `avro:""name""` or `avro:""default""` for potential Avro schema hints or field renames.
        *   Provide handling or clear documentation for Go field types lacking direct Avro equivalents (e.g., custom types, complex nested structures).
4.  **Output:** The program *must* generate the resulting Avro schema as a JSON file named `struct.avsc`, where `struct` is the name of the Go struct (obtained from the second command-line argument).

**Constraints:**

*   **Language:** Go.
*   **Libraries:** Employ packages from the standard library (`go/parser`, `go/ast`). While using helper packages for JSON formatting or Avro schema construction is acceptable, aim to minimize external dependencies for core parsing and schema generation logic.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement clear and informative error handling for file operations, parsing failures, struct identification problems, and invalid schema construction."

2.  **Theme Diversity:** Explore a wide spectrum of topics, from the natural world and philosophical concepts to personal experiences and societal observations, always framing them through the chosen emotional lens.
3.  **Poetic Craftsmanship:** Use language meticulously. Employ rich, sensory imagery, precise vocabulary, evocative metaphors and similes, and potentially incorporate subtle sound devices (alliteration, assonance, consonance) to enhance emotional impact. Prioritize beauty and artistry in your word choice and arrangement.
4.  **Concise Verses:** Though complete poems are welcome, you should also craft short, potent verses or fragments. These short pieces must be self-contained and powerful enough, through their imagery and emotional expression, to linger in a reader's mind.

Now, fulfill my first request: Compose a poem titled ""Ephemeral Embrace"" that embodies the bittersweet beauty of fleeting yet intense romantic love, its inherent transience, and the lasting imprint it leaves."

"summarize this
EZRA KLEIN: See, but I think human beings are, in a weird way on this, bad on temporal reasoning, too, which is partially why I asked the question because let’s say you think the confidence interval here is somewhere between 20 and 100 years. That matters a lot for me. I’m probably not going to be around in 100 years, almost certainly. But in terms of human history, it’s nothing — 20 to 100 years just means really soon.

And if we do get here, it’s a really big, I mean, in some ways, event horizon. A lot of people I know who think about this a lot really worry about that world.

I was very both impressed and unnerved by another A.I. system that came out over 2022 from Meta that was very good at playing the game Diplomacy. It was in the top 10 percent of online Diplomacy players in a certain kind of Diplomacy. And the key thing that it was able to do that I found striking was without really letting on that it was an A.I. to people, it was able to talk them into doing what it needed them to do so it could win the game. It was able to trick people, which is fine. That was what it was told to do, created to do.

But as these things get way better — we’ve already talked about how convincing they can be, that in many ways are getting more convincing than they are anything else at the moment — they’re going to know so much. It’s weird because OpenAI, who we’ve been talking about forever here, they were started by a bunch of people worried about A.I. misalignment. And now they just keep creating more and more powerful A.I. systems, which is another interesting insight into human nature.

But do you worry about these alignment problems? Do you worry not just about the question of an A.I. ending the world or ending humanity, but just A.I.s, I don’t know, just causing huge amounts of damage, becoming weaponry, becoming — it’s a very powerful technology that we don’t really understand what’s happening in it. And we’re moving forward on it very fast.

GARY MARCUS: I do worry about the so-called alignment problem quite a bit. I’m not that worried about the kind of Terminator Skynet scenarios where machines take over the world because I don’t think they’re that interested in that. They’ve never shown any interest.

But I worry about the version of just any time you ask a machine to do something, if it doesn’t really understand who you are, it can misinterpret that request. So let’s put aside for the moment bad actors, but we should come back to that. And let’s put aside machines that are motivated to injure us, which I think is somewhat unlikely, and just talk about the big gray in between, where you ask a machine to do something and doesn’t understand your request.

So in “Rebooting A.I.,” we had the example of you ask a robot to tidy up your room and it winds up cutting up the couch and putting it in the closet because it doesn’t really know which things are important to you and which are not.

There’s, I think, a huge problem right now that we don’t know how to have machines interpret what human beings’ intents are. What is it they want, and all the things that they leave unsaid? And again, I worry that the dominant theme in the Silicon Valley right now is, well, we’ll solve these problems by making bigger sets of data. That’s not really working for truth. It’s not really going to work for intention, either, for having systems really understand our intent.

There’s a bullet that has to be bit, which is building models of what humans are saying and what they mean by those things. And that’s a serious challenge that requires rethinking how we do these things. Right now I don’t think we’re well-positioned to solve the alignment problem. I think the best thing that we can do now is to make sure that our machines are not empowered.

So the risks always come from a mixture of intelligence, or lack of intelligence, and power. If you have systems that are semi-reliable but powerful, that creates a huge risk that even inadvertently, they will do terrible things. So right now we have to come to grips with the fact that A.I. is more and more tempting to use because we can talk to it in English, and it can be witty at times and so forth, but isn’t really in a position where we can trust it.

And so we shouldn’t be giving it much rope. We can’t really be giving it that much opportunity to do things until we can be confident that it does understand the things that we’re asking. And I don’t see how to achieve that unless the systems have a lot of common ground with us. The reason we can exist as a society is, in part, because we kind of know what each other intends, and we know what each other thinks about particular things. We have common ground with them. And the robots, or the machines in general, don’t really have that with us yet.

Again, I don’t think it’s impossible. But it might be another thing that’s not entirely amenable to the big data paradigm. So you’re always, for example, going to have new things that you ask your machines. They might not be in your database, but you want them to handle them well.

And then the other problem is the big data paradigm is mostly about things that we can label, or we can label some of them or something like that. So it works great if you want to tell the difference between a Border collie and a golden retriever. It’s a constant stable thing in the world. You can label them. You can give examples.

But if I want to have a machine understand the difference between believing something and suspecting something, let’s say, it’s not clear, even what the data are, where if I want to tell a machine, don’t cause harm, I can label a bunch of pictures in which harm has taken place, but that’s not really getting across the concept of harm.

And so alignment is, in part, about having machines know that we have values like don’t harm people, be honest, be helpful. And we don’t really know how to communicate those in the big data paradigm.

And this is part of, again, why I come back to these hybrid models that have symbols. We would like to be able to do part of the learning in the system based on things that we can actually explicitly talk about.

By the way, a term we haven’t mentioned today is black box. So the current models are black box models. We don’t understand what’s happening inside of them. And we also can’t directly communicate with them and say, hey, I want you to follow this. So you can’t say at the beginning of a ChatGPT session and expect it to work, please only say true statements in what follows. It just won’t be able to respect that. It doesn’t really understand what you mean by say only true things. And it cannot constrain itself to only say true things.

You wish you could say to the system, don’t say anything that’s potentially harmful and have it compute, well, I’m going to give this medical advice, but I’m going to compute whether this is actually plausible. Or maybe I’ll even call in a human expert if I’m not sure if this is actually safe. We just don’t know how to program that in yet. Again, not impossible, but not part of the current technology.

And since our current technology does not allow us to directly specify any set of rules that we want to play by within our language systems, we have a problem right now.

Question title: What is the difference between jaxb-impl and jaxb-runtime?

Question body: Clearly the com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl artifact is labelled ""Old JAXB Runtime module"" in the maven repository (see link below), and yet both of these artifacts are still getting new releases:

https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.glassfish.jaxb/jaxb-runtime https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.sun.xml.bind/jaxb-impl

This answer Which artifacts should I use for JAXB RI in my Maven project? does not clarify the difference.

The accepted answer to both the above question and this one How to resolve java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/xml/bind/JAXBException conclude that for Java 9+ you should use: org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime

But I have code using com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl and it appears to be working fine. So what do I lose or gain by moving to jaxb-runtime?

Even the latest (3.0.2 at the time I write this) version is available for the ""OLD"" jaxb-impl module. If Oracle isn't doing this anymore, who makes the com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl artifact? What is it for? Why doesn't it share the Maven group coordinates with jaxb-runtime?

Is there any central location that clearly documents what the current state of affairs is with JAXB?

There is just so much confusion with JAXB now.

P.S. I need to remain compatible with Java 8 for the time being - so I can't go to 3.x yet, and 2.4.x appears to be an abandoned attempt at fixing the modularity that they foolishly broke when it was split out of the JDK.

In which case should I use a record?JAXB, or Java Architecture for XML Binding, is a Java standard for working with XML data. The jaxb-impl and jaxb-runtime artifacts are both implementations of this standard, but they have some differences in terms of their history, development, and usage.The com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl artifact is the old JAXB implementation that was developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) and was included in Java 6 and Java 7. This implementation has been labeled ""old"" because it is no longer being actively developed or maintained by Oracle, and it may not be compatible with newer versions of Java.The org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime artifact is a newer JAXB implementation that was developed as part of the GlassFish application server project. This implementation is compatible with Java 9 and later, and it is still being actively developed and maintained.In general, it's recommended to use the org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime artifact for new projects that are intended to run on Java 9 or later, as it is the most up-to-date and supported implementation available. If you have existing code that uses the com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl artifact and it is working fine for you, you could continue to use it, but be aware that it may not be compatible with newer versions of Java and may not receive updates or bug fixes.Regarding your question on records, records are a new feature introduced in Java 14. Records provide a compact syntax for declaring classes that are similar to a struct in C or C++, or a data class in Kotlin. They are intended to be used as simple data holders, with most of the behavior (e.g. constructors, equals, hashCode, toString) being generated automatically. You can use a record if you want a simple data class that is easy to create, read, and use.I hope this helps clear up some of the confusion about the difference between jaxb-impl and jaxb-runtime. There's not a central location that documents the current state of JAXB because it's standard part of Java and developed by Oracle, but Oracle provides documentation on the Java standard library which may be helpful.","Question title: What is the difference between jaxb-impl and jaxb-runtime?

    *   This event causes the protagonist, Rob Nguyen, to become separated from his visiting friends.
    *   Wandering alone during this strange occurrence, he stumbles upon a secret, ancient tomb or hidden location within Hue.
    *   Inside this place, he makes the fated discovery of the martial inheritance linked to his ancestor.
4.  **Tone & Style:** Employ evocative descriptions of Hue's historical significance and the unfolding mystical atmosphere. The discovery should be portrayed with a sense of awe, fate, and perhaps the weight of tradition or destiny.

Prompt: I'm making game were the goal is too stack fruit, how want to think to different ways the fruit can interact with one another in the the stack for example you have to stack the fruit in a certain order or the fruit underneath will get destroyed can you think of other examples",True,28673,"Generate a list of diverse gameplay mechanics and interaction possibilities related to fruit stacking, suitable for incorporation into a game. The mechanics should focus on how fruit behaves and interacts within the stack. Provide specific examples for each interaction type, drawing inspiration from various puzzle, strategy, or casual stacking games.

Categorize the mechanics into distinct types, such as:
1.  **Shape/Positioning:** Rules requiring stacking fruit in a specific geometric pattern, balancing precariously, or achieving a maximum height.
2.  **Material/Destruction:** Elements causing fruit to degrade, shatter, fall apart, or activate mechanisms (e.g., bombs, melting effects).
3.  **Ordering/Sequence:** Objectives or penalties based on stacking certain types of fruit on top of others, or adhering to a pre-defined order.
4.  **Physics & Stability:** Mechanics governing how the stack sways, collapses, or reacts to player input (e.g., force application, sliding).
5.  **Type-Specific:** Abilities or interactions unique to individual fruit types (e.g., exploding oranges, slippery bananas, heavy watermelons).
6.  **Power-Ups/Consumables:** Items or actions that dynamically alter fruit properties (e.g., glue, temporary invincibility, speed boost).

For each mechanic, explain the core concept and provide 2-3 example implementations or variations relevant to the game design. The overall tone should be brainstorming, presenting a range of creative possibilities.

**Reference:** No external websites need to be consulted for this task; generate the ideas internally.

Captain Jean-Luc Picard tells Data that “it is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness – that is life.” Discuss.)
the essay I have written is listed within the following parentheses: (Years ago, I was listening to a friend play a beautiful piece of music on the piano. My mom loved it, so I decided to learn the piece to play it for her. I carefully practiced and followed the sheet music, making sure all the notes were right. However, it didn't turn out nearly as well. The music lacked the dynamics and emotional depth that made my friend's performance so delightful. Instead, my playing sounded robotic and uninspired. It was at this moment I realized that making no mistakes is just one dimension of the many that contribute to success. In order to truly succeed, I must consider all of the angles and strive to excel in each of them. This inspired me to embrace and appreciate many activities I had previously ignored, viewing them as opportunities rather than risks. I completed my ARCT diploma for piano and began saxophone and violin, winning numerous scholarships for all three instruments. I took six courses in a semester and am graduating a year early. In addition, I joined my school's symphonic and pop bands and the music council, finding that every experience builds on who I am and surrounds me with a community of like-minded people. Outside of school, I volunteered at Milton hospital, Arkell medical clinic, and musical organizations, and I worked at a golf club and dental office.
Devoted to sharing the power of resilience, I wanted to help others understand what I had once failed to. I am soon completing my lifeguard and swim instructor exams in hope to connect with young swimmers and inspire them to persevere. In addition, I work part-time as a piano teacher and I enjoy helping my students improve and embracing the growth that comes from making mistakes.
Although losing is a part of everyone’s life,  I’ve learned to embrace and appreciate the journey of growth and self-improvement, rather than focusing solely on achieving infallibility.)

please rewrite the essay taking the following points into consideration. the points in parentheses are purely ideas and may be ignored:
list thesis fairly clearly
Define my definition of a mistake 
(Everyone can approach a music a diff way and it doesn’t mean it’s wrong it’s just a different way of expression - maybe helps piano teacher or performance or something?)
Remove most achievements-- pick maybe just one relevant achievement and quickly mention it
expand on my story, maybe about me returning to the piano piece and finally playing it well
talk also more about what I learned from my experience
discuss more about answering the question, the ""that is not a weakness, that is life""
(small mistakes of life - imperfections make life perfect?)

Captain Jean-Luc Picard tells Data that “it is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness – that is life.” Discuss.)
the essay I have written is listed within the following parentheses: (Years ago, I was listening to a friend play a beautiful piece of music on the piano. My mom loved it, so I decided to learn the piece to play it for her. I carefully practiced and followed the sheet music, making sure all the notes were right. However, it didn't turn out nearly as well. The music lacked the dynamics and emotional depth that made my friend's performance so delightful. Instead, my playing sounded robotic and uninspired. It was at this moment I realized that making no mistakes is just one dimension of the many that contribute to success. In order to truly succeed, I must consider all of the angles and strive to excel in each of them. This inspired me to embrace and appreciate many activities I had previously ignored, viewing them as opportunities rather than risks. I completed my ARCT diploma for piano and began saxophone and violin, winning numerous scholarships for all three instruments. I took six courses in a semester and am graduating a year early. In addition, I joined my school's symphonic and pop bands and the music council, finding that every experience builds on who I am and surrounds me with a community of like-minded people. Outside of school, I volunteered at Milton hospital, Arkell medical clinic, and musical organizations, and I worked at a golf club and dental office.
Devoted to sharing the power of resilience, I wanted to help others understand what I had once failed to. I am soon completing my lifeguard and swim instructor exams in hope to connect with young swimmers and inspire them to persevere. In addition, I work part-time as a piano teacher and I enjoy helping my students improve and embracing the growth that comes from making mistakes.
Although losing is a part of everyone’s life,  I’ve learned to embrace and appreciate the journey of growth and self-improvement, rather than focusing solely on achieving infallibility.)","please rewrite the essay taking the following points into consideration. the points in parentheses are purely ideas and may be ignored:
list thesis fairly clearly
Define my definition of a mistake 
(Everyone can approach a music a diff way and it doesn’t mean it’s wrong it’s just a different way of expression - maybe helps piano teacher or performance or something?)
Remove most achievements-- pick maybe just one relevant achievement and quickly mention it
expand on my story, maybe about me returning to the piano piece and finally playing it well
talk also more about what I learned from my experience
discuss more about answering the question, the ""that is not a weakness, that is life""

(if a robot painted a painting it might not be perfect)",True,52123,"Assume the persona of an expert university application essay consultant. Your task is to refine the provided essay draft (enclosed in parentheses) based on the following critical evaluation points.

**Objectives:**
1.  **Develop a Clear Thesis:** Craft a concise and arguable thesis statement that directly addresses the core concept of the prompt (the necessity of accepting imperfection and losing as part of growth and life's richness) in relation to the applicant's personal experience. Place this thesis strategically at the appropriate point within the revised essay.
2.  **Define 'Mistake' within Your Narrative:** Ensure the essay establishes *your specific, internal understanding* of what constitutes a ""mistake"" within the context of your chosen personal anecdote (the piano piece, and potentially its connection to Data's experience). Explicitly reveal this definition through your reflections on the experience, tying it back to the prompt's themes.
3.  **Refocus on Learning and Growth:** Significantly expand the section detailing your *internal learning, emotional development, and newfound appreciation* for resilience and the value of overcoming challenges. Emphasize the transition in your perspective triggered by this experience.
4.  **Deepen the Connection to the Prompt:** Explicitly and substantively discuss how the essay's central anecdote illustrates the same principle as Data's experience in the Star Trek quote. Clearly explain your understanding of the phrase ""it is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness – that is life,"" and how it resonates with your personal journey. Weave this reflection naturally throughout the essay.
5.  **Refine References to Achievements:** Condense the list of achievements provided. Focus on including *only one or two* that are most directly relevant to illustrating your understanding of growth, accepting imperfection, or embodying resilience in a tangible way. Mention these concisely, focusing primarily on their role within the narrative of learning and personal development rather than simply listing them.
6.  **Develop a Narrative Peak:** Instead of a list of achievements, focus on crafting a compelling narrative climax or resolution for your core anecdote. Describe a significant moment where you successfully embody the lesson learned (e.g., playing the piano piece effectively after internalizing the importance of more than just precision) or when you connect with others by teaching or sharing your perspective. Conclude by explicitly stating how this outcome demonstrates the principle of thriving despite imperfections.

**Constraints:**
-   Strictly use the provided essay draft as the starting point for revision.
-   Integrate the required elements smoothly and organically within the narrative and reflective structure.
-   Maintain a coherent and engaging personal essay tone throughout.

Generate the revised essay, integrating these core improvements."

**Your Task:** Generate a detailed business plan outline focusing on the marketing and value proposition for a handmade furniture company that distinguishes itself through old-world craftsmanship.

**Core Objective:** To build a customer-centric marketing plan explicitly demonstrating how the unique qualities of handmade furniture produced with traditional, time-tested techniques (e.g., mortise and tenon, dovetails, hand-finishing) resonate with and address the specific needs and desires outlined by Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs within this customer segment.

**Mandatory Components of the Outline:**

1.  **Executive Summary (Marketing Focus):** Brief outline highlighting the company's unique value proposition based on craftsmanship and customer needs within Maslow's Hierarchy.
2.  **Target Customer Deep Dive:**
    *   Define the primary target customer profile: (Age range, lifestyle segment, income level, key motivations, specific furniture purchasing habits, pre-conceptions about handmade vs. mass-produced).
    *   Analyze their primary need stage within Maslow's Hierarchy (e.g., Belonging/Love & Esteem needs - status, uniqueness, community connection through custom design; possibly reaching into Self-Actualization - expressing values, desire for quality & legacy).
3.  **Competitive Analysis:**
    *   Identify primary competitors (e.g., high-end mass-produced brands, other custom furniture makers).
    *   Highlight how the unique benefits of old-world craftsmanship differentiate the company and directly address the target customer's unmet needs (emotional connection, quality perceptions, values aligned).
4.  **Value Proposition - The 'Why' of Handmade Craftsmanship:**
    *   **Needs-Based Value Pillars:** Detail specific value pillars linking old-world craftsmanship to customer needs based on Maslow's stage (e.g., for Esteem needs: ""Own a piece as unique and timeless as you are,"" or for Self-Actualization: ""Invest in furniture that reflects your values of lasting quality and authentic heritage"").
    *   **Key Value Elements:**
        *   **Uniqueness & Customization:** Addressing desires for individuality, personalization.
        *   **Quality & Durability:** Meeting long-term investment, reducing waste, and creating a legacy.
        *   **Authenticity & Heritage:** Connecting to craft traditions, meaningful objects, and rejecting throwaway culture.
        *   **Aesthetic Appeal & Craftsmanship:** Satisfying visual appreciation, tactile quality, and supporting genuine artistry.
        *   **Emotional Connection:** Building meaning through bespoke processes, story, and lasting ownership.
        *   **Sustainability & Values:** Linking traditional methods to quality-over-quantity, minimizing waste, supporting skilled labor.
    *   **Avoid Generic Claims:** Ground your value proposition firmly in *what* old-world methods deliver in *terms* of customer benefits and emotional needs.
5.  **Marketing Strategy Outline:**
    *   **Segmentation & Niche Focus:** Refine targeting based on need-state affinity (e.g., focusing on ""Esteem Seekers"" or ""Conscious Consumers"").
    *   **Messaging & Storytelling:**
        *   **Narrative Approach:** How will you tell the story of the craftsmanship, materials, and the *value* the customer gets (e.g., ""Furniture that speaks to your values"", ""The legacy of enduring craftsmanship for discerning homes"").
        *   **Resonance:** Use specific language that evokes the target customer's aspiration, value their investment in quality, and respects their desire for enduring authenticity.
    *   **Branding & Visual Identity:** Consider how to communicate the value pillars (e.g., heritage, uniqueness, durability) visually and tonally across all platforms (website, social media, brochures, showroom).
    *   **Distribution & Experience:** How will the customer experience reflect the value (e.g., personalized service, showroom ambiance, bespoke consultation)?
    *   **Call to Action:** Frame calls to action based on Maslow's needs addressed (e.g., ""Express Yourself with Custom Design,"" ""Invest in Timeless Value,"" ""Discover the Legacy of Craftsmanship"").
6.  **Pricing Strategy Outline:** Justify pricing based on the value offered (unique craftsmanship, quality, legacy) for the target segment, relative to competitors.
7.  **Financial Projections:** Include basic outline components (e.g., Estimated startup costs, Revenue projections, Marketing budget outline).

**Output Format:** Provide a clear, numbered business plan outline with sections and detailed sub-bullets. Each bullet should explain the purpose of that element in building a customer-centric value proposition focused on Maslow's Hierarchy and old-world craftsmanship.

Ensure the outline is highly specific and actionable, focusing on how the unique attributes of the business directly address the unmet needs and desires of the target customer within their relevant Maslowian need state."

Use clear function/class definitions, comments explaining key steps, and ensure the script is ready to be run (though it will require vocabulary/tokenization setup). Focus on functional correctness and the core architectural concepts rather than perfect performance or tokenization detail."

Following a formal salutation addressing the relevant HDB department, structure the letter logically with distinct paragraphs.

The primary arguments for the refund should be articulated clearly and persuasively, referencing relevant policies or humanitarian considerations if appropriate:

1.  **COVID-Related MOP Fulfillment Difficulty:** Detail how construction delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic prevented the buyers from meeting the Minimum Occupancy Period (MOP) requirement. Explain that due to the disruption, they were forced to secure temporary rental accommodation, specifically a two-year lease, which further complicated their ability to adhere to the MOP timeline. Frame this challenge as beyond their control and a direct consequence of the pandemic.
2.  **Significant Family Circumstance Requiring Relocation:** Emphasize the compelling need for the buyers to live closer to the maternal grandparents, who are now the primary caregivers for their baby. Justify this need by explicitly mentioning the advanced age and limited capacity of the paternal grandparents to provide adequate care. Present this reason as a significant and pressing family concern, crucial for the child's well-being, which warrants exceptional consideration.

Conclude the letter by formally requesting the refund of the down payment, outlining the intended course of action (e.g., selling the flat) to HDB and expressing gratitude for their understanding and willingness to review this appeal.

I am not sure I agree as I can list famous applied behavioural scientists leading industry teams (Rory Sutherland, David Halpern, Maya Shankar etc.). The many famous behavioural scientists I am familiar with have an array of academic, industry and government experience (equivalent to leading teams).
I agree that it may be difficult to build credibility in an applied setting though as often the projects have a commercial sensitivity about them and/or employees are restricted in what they can say publically (as it can impact the company's brand or even share price).
I have now (literally while writing this) developed an interesting hypothesis. I'd like to know if many famous behavioural scientists choose to work in academia (and work with industry) so that they have the freedom to communicate without restriction.

I can certainly list peers too, although when asked to name famous applied behavioral scientists in a recent MBA class at Columbia, most students named academics (Katy, Dan, etc.).

But I suspect you’re on to something about talking out loud. Academics have more time to write books, more freedom to do so, and greater rewards for doing so. They can often publish work (ditto for government folks) that industry folks can’t, although almost all of my employers have been exceedingly kind - my own lack of case study write ups is more about time and inclination than restriction (I’m also not explicitly rewarded for case studies in the same way as academics).

Not that I consider myself a “famous” behavioral economist, but yes, I truly enjoy academia because my research question and the answer doesn’t have to fit a “for profit” agenda or a company line. Also, I can go far deeper into a question than when I do consulting work because there is no deadline. The only deadline is the correct answer. There is no need for the result to be applicable right away. It’s also much more about developing a deeper and general understanding of behavior, rather than how behavior relates to one particular company and situation. 

As far as I know, Dan Ariely doesn’t do any active research anymore. He mostly does consulting and other company work. Many academics in behavioral science work closely with companies. Compared to their research output these engagements are just far less visible.

Christina Gravert Academia has a meaninfully different definition of what “right” means. In applied, right means “an ethical solution that changes behavior often enough at a cost/benefit ratio that is attractive to scale”. In academia, it is “p 0.05 and the ability to replicate”. So I think your last sentence is the right one - one exists to solve a problem, the other exists to further knowledge.

The post is about venerating knowledge generators as if they were behavior changers, when in fact they aren’t and use a different methodology and success criteria. No law against enjoying both. =]

Matt Wallaert I think the most curious thing is that those people that are perceived as “famous” by your MBA students etc, aren’t (usually) the best academics. At least not in behavioral economics. The famous ones are the science communicators, the ones on podcasts and who write popular science books. So these people get invited to speak because they make an effort to get invited and because they are skilled in communicating. So if practitioners want to get invited more, they might need to get out there more.

Matt Wallaert You should do that! I think it will be hard to evaluate who is actually great and not just famous ( in a company or in academia). Academia might be a bit easier with citations in respected journals. But how do you measure success in applying behavioral science in business?

That's interesting; judging my DMs today, I don't think the applied side of the fence likely feels that way. 

But we could come up with some sort of behavioral test. How many panels, speaking opps, interviews, etc. have you personally turned down and sent to someone who has run behavioral science inside an organization, because you genuinely felt they were better equipped to answer those questions? Ditto for consulting opportunities?

For transparency, while I do send opps around to other practioners, I don't think I've ever sent such an opp to an academic (likely because I don't get invited to academic panels). I'd hope that I would have the courage to do that if the question itself was academic.

Matt Wallaert I guess it depends on whether it's a panel or consulting on the ""science"" or on using it in an organizational context [what some might call the science of using science] **text in brackets added later to clarify**. If the latter, then people like William R. Mailer Francesca Tamma Michael Hallsworth Nathalie Spencer Rory Sutherland Melanie Kim Piyush Tantia etc. are way better!

Also I wouldn't overgeneralize (as many of the commentators seem to) that academics have no practical experience. Those that consult for instance are perhaps advantaged in seeing different operating models and industries.

Finally fields like machine learning are similar, all the early big names were from academia. I think it's likely true for any new scientific discipline (unlike a mature HR that you cite as an example) but as the discipline matures, then we have enough HQPs outside academia.

All this to say, I think the situation is a bit more nuanced than ""academics vs practitioners"" and having scientists at the forefront of a science in its early applied years is not weird at all.

Dilip Soman You seem to be drawing a distinction I’m not sure I agree with. In the last paragraph, you seemed to suggest that only academics are scientists. And in the first, you drew a consulting distinction between “the science” and using the science.

To me, applied behavioral science is using science as a method for changing behavior. That means practitioners are scientists. Simply because their focus is on specific on a method for finding specific in-situ solutions rather than generalizable knowledge doesn’t make them any less scientists. 

You are absolutely right - there is a spectrum in how people spend their time and some people do both. I was shorthanding and it is a good clairification. Just as I would generally expect full-time academics to be better at generating knowledge, I would expect full-time practitioners to be better at running the behavioral science process in an organization.

You’re absolutely right about data science; it was originally lead by academics. But it didn’t stay that way. How are we pushing forward?

Matt Wallaert I'm using the stricter definition of science which is theory development and testing. The definition you used - I would call applied science or behavioral engineering.

How we move it forward is a great question. It's really by training and developing a quarter of highly qualified professionals. Programs like LSE's masters programs are key, But in my opinion it is equally important to embed these skills and knowledge sets in a traditional MBA and related program

Dilip Soman Certainly generalized theory is a specific use of the scientific method; I’m not sure I would call it stricter persay. But this whole post was about “applied behavioral science” (I swear I didn’t edit it) so now I’ve lost the thread - were you talking about academics being the better choice for generalizable theory the whole time? If so, I’m in violent agreement but don’t understand how it relates to consulting.

I think MBA programs are prime for this; the context of this comment was having just lectured at Columbia’s business school and having students name mostly academics when I asked them if they knew of any applied behavioral scientists. =]

Matt Wallaert Nah I was only referring to how we use the word ""science"" differently. It's the classic science vs engineering dichotomy (which might really be a spectrum). But this is all a distraction from the main point, you're right - I absolutely agree that this needs to be better embedded in the core management degree programs.

On terminology, in one of our partnership books we make the case for treating academic versus practitioner (where you work) and science versus engineering (what you do) orthogonally. Therefore one could be a practitioner and be engaged in science, likewise one could be in academia and be engaged in engineering.

Dilip Soman I don’t think it is quite classic engineering spectrum. If I’m building a bridge, I don’t generally run a pilot on the classic sense because gravity is a known. If I’m changing behavior, I can use prospect theory as a guide but there are a million reasons it might not work in that specific situation and thus have to use the scientific method, take it as theory, and test. The average applied BeSci is using the scientific method far more than the average mechanical, computer, or other engineer.

I do think we actually disagree, which shouldn’t be surprising given our different backgrounds. I also think that’s an OK thing; differing perspectives is a good thing for pushing a field forward.

Matt Wallaert Ah yes +1 to disagreement. I'll quickly add that in Behavioral Science in the Wild we do talk extensively about the lack of portability of results and it being a feature of beh science vs. other sciences (though as an engineer I can confirm that there's a LOT of testing in building machines and bridges, though ofc it's not an RCT). I don't think we as a field have good label for a behavioural engineer.

In any event, happy to agree to disagree on this one. It's just an issue of terminology, I think we agree on the key opinions.

And yes, didn’t mean to overstate the degree to which mechanical engineers test, simply to make the point that on the sliding scale, they have to test less because more of their underlying forces are known.

Then we just need clearer terminology. I don't see any disagreements in opinions about what academic researchers do vs. practitioners driving practical problems in organizations do in terms of activity sets (esp. when it comes to defining ""success"" in respective careers). It's just that we disagree on what labels to give those activities. That's why I also like the decoupling of practitioner-academic (i.e., who you work for and what it means for career) vs, science-engineering (i.e., the kind of activity sets you engage in). The world happily assumes that they are perfectly correlated - they certainly are not.

On terminology going beyond science vs. engineering- in medicine there's a distinction between ""medical science"" (loosely, what academics do) and ""implementation science"" (how its used in patient care). Likewise, John List Nina Mažar (Mazar) and I would suggest that there is a distinction between ""science"" and the ""science of using science"" Maybe a high-council needs to take all these terms, and come up with some cleaner labels to describe different activity sets :-)

Dilip Soman So there is an area of disagreement: I believe they are correlated (maybe not perfectly but probably pretty high). People who do engineering all day, every day and their success depends on it are better at engineering and I can’t imagine an academic whose job success is predicated on their ability to be an engineer.

For non-correlation to occur, I feel like you'd have to argue reward criteria dont matter. As an example, I get paid on my ability to get people to actually do behavioral science in orgs, so I've become very good at that. And when project work comes my way (finding a specific intervention), I refer that out to ideas42, frog, and others because I am no longer the best person to solve it.

And maybe that’s what you’re saying. But then wouldn’t you agree that our current overrotation on people in the academic setting is odd?

Great question and discussion, and I am a little late in seeing it.

My quick take:

In general, practitioners who do BS in an organisation are often specialised and lack generalisable knowledge and expertise. How to do BS in one sector of IT is not the same as knowing what should be done elsewhere outside your industry. They also lack confidence that they have anything useful to share because they don't know what everyone else is doing.

Even if they know useful things, they aren't well incentivised or equipped to share that knowledge relative to just doing more work in their org etc.

In contrast, academics are rewarded for sharing high level knowledge about BS and can get a good overview about practice in many settings. This sets them up well to understand best practice and produce related content. These papers and interviews get picked up, and they build a following. Unfortunately, many academics aren't incentivised to really understand applied contexts, so they can easily miss some of the detail and get things wrong.

All of the above reminds me of the saying that those who know don't speak, and those who speak don't know! I am of course an exception ;)

I am not sure I agree as I can list famous applied behavioural scientists leading industry teams (Rory Sutherland, David Halpern, Maya Shankar etc.). The many famous behavioural scientists I am familiar with have an array of academic, industry and government experience (equivalent to leading teams).
I agree that it may be difficult to build credibility in an applied setting though as often the projects have a commercial sensitivity about them and/or employees are restricted in what they can say publically (as it can impact the company's brand or even share price).
I have now (literally while writing this) developed an interesting hypothesis. I'd like to know if many famous behavioural scientists choose to work in academia (and work with industry) so that they have the freedom to communicate without restriction.

I can certainly list peers too, although when asked to name famous applied behavioral scientists in a recent MBA class at Columbia, most students named academics (Katy, Dan, etc.).

But I suspect you’re on to something about talking out loud. Academics have more time to write books, more freedom to do so, and greater rewards for doing so. They can often publish work (ditto for government folks) that industry folks can’t, although almost all of my employers have been exceedingly kind - my own lack of case study write ups is more about time and inclination than restriction (I’m also not explicitly rewarded for case studies in the same way as academics).

Not that I consider myself a “famous” behavioral economist, but yes, I truly enjoy academia because my research question and the answer doesn’t have to fit a “for profit” agenda or a company line. Also, I can go far deeper into a question than when I do consulting work because there is no deadline. The only deadline is the correct answer. There is no need for the result to be applicable right away. It’s also much more about developing a deeper and general understanding of behavior, rather than how behavior relates to one particular company and situation. 

As far as I know, Dan Ariely doesn’t do any active research anymore. He mostly does consulting and other company work. Many academics in behavioral science work closely with companies. Compared to their research output these engagements are just far less visible.

Christina Gravert Academia has a meaninfully different definition of what “right” means. In applied, right means “an ethical solution that changes behavior often enough at a cost/benefit ratio that is attractive to scale”. In academia, it is “p 0.05 and the ability to replicate”. So I think your last sentence is the right one - one exists to solve a problem, the other exists to further knowledge.

The post is about venerating knowledge generators as if they were behavior changers, when in fact they aren’t and use a different methodology and success criteria. No law against enjoying both. =]

Matt Wallaert I think the most curious thing is that those people that are perceived as “famous” by your MBA students etc, aren’t (usually) the best academics. At least not in behavioral economics. The famous ones are the science communicators, the ones on podcasts and who write popular science books. So these people get invited to speak because they make an effort to get invited and because they are skilled in communicating. So if practitioners want to get invited more, they might need to get out there more.

Matt Wallaert You should do that! I think it will be hard to evaluate who is actually great and not just famous ( in a company or in academia). Academia might be a bit easier with citations in respected journals. But how do you measure success in applying behavioral science in business?

That's interesting; judging my DMs today, I don't think the applied side of the fence likely feels that way. 

But we could come up with some sort of behavioral test. How many panels, speaking opps, interviews, etc. have you personally turned down and sent to someone who has run behavioral science inside an organization, because you genuinely felt they were better equipped to answer those questions? Ditto for consulting opportunities?

For transparency, while I do send opps around to other practioners, I don't think I've ever sent such an opp to an academic (likely because I don't get invited to academic panels). I'd hope that I would have the courage to do that if the question itself was academic.

Matt Wallaert I guess it depends on whether it's a panel or consulting on the ""science"" or on using it in an organizational context [what some might call the science of using science] **text in brackets added later to clarify**. If the latter, then people like William R. Mailer Francesca Tamma Michael Hallsworth Nathalie Spencer Rory Sutherland Melanie Kim Piyush Tantia etc. are way better!

Also I wouldn't overgeneralize (as many of the commentators seem to) that academics have no practical experience. Those that consult for instance are perhaps advantaged in seeing different operating models and industries.

Finally fields like machine learning are similar, all the early big names were from academia. I think it's likely true for any new scientific discipline (unlike a mature HR that you cite as an example) but as the discipline matures, then we have enough HQPs outside academia.

All this to say, I think the situation is a bit more nuanced than ""academics vs practitioners"" and having scientists at the forefront of a science in its early applied years is not weird at all.

all right [Music] what happens when you start eating carrots every day carrots are one of the healthiest vegetables you can eat they are rich in vitamins minerals and fiber they have also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects and protect against many diseases but have you ever wondered what happens when you start eating carrots every day in this video we are going to be talking about the amazing health benefits of adding carrots to your diet before we proceed please note that everything mentioned in this video is unbiased fact checked and reviewed by qualified health professionals with that said let's jump in and talk about how carrots can improve our health number one strengthens your bones carrots play a huge role in keeping your bones strong as we age this is because it contains Vitamin K Vitamin K is an essential fat soluble vitamin that helps maintain bone density and prevent fractures it also helps form osteocalcin which is a protein that binds calcium ions in your bones this builds strong bones and prevents them from becoming brittle or fragile without enough vitamin K your body cannot use calcium that well this can lead to weak brittle bones or osteoporosis vitamin K also has been shown to help prevent coronary artery calcification which is the buildup of calcium in the arteries the same process that occurs in your bones happens in your arteries too as we get older arteries become stiffer and less flexible over time if you don't have enough vitamin K2 researchers at Tufts University recently discovered that eating more carrots can help build stronger bones by improving calcium absorption which can reduce the risk of osteoporosis for their study they put participants on a low calcium diet and measured how much calcium they absorbed over time then they had them eat one cup of carrot juice every day for two weeks to see if it would increase their bone mineral density the results were pretty impressive the participants who ate a cup of carrots each day experienced an eight percent increase in bone density after just two weeks this means that consuming extra carrots may help prevent osteoporosis and keep bones strong as we age number two improves Eye Health carrots are not only delicious but they can also be an excellent addition to your diet if you have eye problems carrots contain vitamin A and beta-carotene which help improve eyesight and prevent macular degeneration and cataracts vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin that has several functions in the human body including Vision it plays an important role in the health of your eyes and skin and it helps regulate the immune system vitamin A deficiency can cause night blindness which is when you are unable to see in dim or low light conditions the condition is caused by changes in the retina which prevent it from responding properly to incoming light beta-carotene on the other hand is a carotenoid that's naturally found in plants especially those with orange yellow and red colorings it gives carrots their orange Hue for example beta-carotene is an antioxidant that helps protect against free radical damage in the body free radicals can damage cells in our bodies increasing our risk for certain diseases like cancer and age-related macular degeneration number three helps reduce allergy flare-ups carrot protein has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties which can be beneficial for people who suffer from allergies they found that when a person is exposed to an allergen such as pollen an immune response is triggered by a type of white blood cells called t cells this causes inflammation which can cause symptoms such as sneezing and a runny nose in some cases it can lead to anaphylaxis or an extreme allergic reaction where the Airways become blocked however if someone has high levels of carotenoids in their blood their immune system will be less reactive and less likely to trigger an inflammatory response researchers from the University of Alberta investigated if this protein could affect asthma symptoms by experimenting on mice that were allergic to dust mites they found that those that were given carrot protein showed less severe lung inflammation than those who weren't fed the supplement the team believes that the reason for this is down to the anti-inflammatory properties of carrot protein which reduces swelling in tissues this means that when we eat carrots our bodies produce less histamine which is an inflammatory substance released during allergic reactions the researchers hope that these findings will lead to new treatments for people with allergies and asthma liking our video so far before we move on to the next benefit don't forget to hit the like button and subscribe to our

You are tasked with architecting two distinct authentication services within your Flutter application's domain layer:

1.  **Primary Authentication Service:** [Description of its core responsibilities, methods like `login`, `logout`, `checkAuthStatus` if applicable]. This service represents the core authentication logic.
2.  **Secondary Authentication Service:** [Description of its distinct requirements, potentially specializing in different providers (e.g., SAML, Firebase, OAuth2), possessing similar, overlapping methods, but *also* including unique, abstract methods specific to its function].

**Provide a design proposal consisting of the following components:**

1.  **Interfaces/Abstract Class:** Design the core `AuthenticationService` entity. This interface must include all common authentication methods (e.g., `login`, `logout`) and *define* the abstract signatures (or abstract methods if using an abstract class) for the methods specific to the Secondary Authentication Service. Ensure clear documentation for each method signature.
2.  **Concrete Implementations:** Describe briefly how the two specific implementations (Primary Authentication Service and Secondary Authentication Service) would implement the `AuthenticationService` interface or abstract class. This must address both the common authentication methods and the unique abstract requirements of the Secondary Authentication Service.
3.  **Benefits of Proposed Architecture:** Explain clearly how your architecture addresses the challenges of managing similar yet distinct authentication logic within the clean architecture framework, emphasizing reusability, separation of concerns, and potential for future expansion or refactoring."

Hi, I want to connect to IBKR using python to get the market data from NASDAQ, NYSE and CBOE, how can I do it?",False,12114,"Act as an expert Python developer specializing in interacting with the Interactive Brokers API.

**Goal:** Provide a Python code example demonstrating the connection to the IBKR API and the retrieval of real-time market data (bid, ask, last price) for the following three equity symbols traded on their respective exchanges:
1.  **AAPL (Nasdaq)**
2.  **MSFT (NYSE)**
3.  **SPY (CBOE)**

**Requirements for the Output:**
*   **Correctness:** The code must reliably connect to the IBKR TWS/Gateway API and fetch the required real-time data.
*   **Clarity:** Use clear variable names, comments, and appropriate formatting.
*   **Code Explanation:** Include a brief explanation accompanying the code to describe how it works, focusing on connection establishment, subscription for real-time bars, and handling data updates.
*   **Error Handling (Minimal):** Include basic error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) for common issues like connection errors or data retrieval failures.
*   **Library:** Assume the use of the official `ibapi` library (Interactive Brokers API for Python).
*   **Connection Details:** Assume the connection is to the local TWS/Gateway application on the default port (7497 for TWS, 4002 for Gateway). Ensure the code explicitly specifies the host (`localhost`), port, client ID (e.g., `1`), and optional account and optional TWS/Gateway path, according to the `ibapi` library requirements.
*   **Ticker Specification:** For each instrument, explicitly create a `ibapi.contract.Contract` object, setting the `symbol`, `secType` (e.g., `'STK'`), `exchange`, and `currency`.
*   **Data Subscription:** Demonstrate subscribing to real-time market data using `ibapi.client.Client.reqRealTimeBars()`.
*   **Data Handling:** Implement basic logic using an `EWrapper` class to process the incoming `ibapi.common.RealTimeBar` events and print the requested information (bid, ask, last price).
*   **Termination:** Demonstrate stopping the data stream and disconnecting gracefully using the `Client` instance.
*   **Concurrency Note:** Briefly mention that you are handling asynchronous data streams using `ibapi`'s main loop, and therefore, direct synchronous returns like `client.reqContractDetails()` are unnecessary for real-time data retrieval in this context.

**Provide the complete, executable Python code following these specifications.**"

    *   Ava's support during a challenging time for Sebastian (e.g., home life conflicts, creative blocks).
    *   Hints of shared loneliness and a growing desire for connection.
    *   Meaningful glances, indirect communication, or small gestures of growing affection.
    *   Avoid explicitly stating ""they fell in love""; focus on showing the subtle, everyday moments of connection.
5.  **Structure:** Ensure the script features distinct scenes that develop Ava's relationship with both the town and Sebastian.
6.  **Target Output:** Generate the first 5-7 pages of this script, focusing on the initial introduction of Ava, Sebastian's reclusiveness (contrasted by her presence), and their initial, subtle interactions within the backdrop of the Stardew Valley environment."

        *   Use `WebClient` to asynchronously fetch data from the external API.
        *   Extract specific fields from the JSON response required in the `ApiResponse` entity.
        *   Combine the extracted fields with `id`, `description` from the initial `ApiDetail` (if available).
        *   Add the current timestamp using `LocalDateTime.now(ZoneId.of(""Asia/Kolkata""))`.
        *   Construct the final `ApiResponse` object to be saved.
*   **Kafka Integration:**
    *   Add necessary dependencies for Spring Kafka.
    *   Implement a `KafkaProducer` class to send the complete `ApiResponse` object (serialized using JSON) to a designated Kafka topic.
    *   Publish the constructed `ApiResponse` object to the Kafka topic after it is saved in MongoDB.
*   **Service Structure:**
    *   Organize the code into well-defined Spring components:
        *   REST Controller (optional, for health check or configuration endpoints).
        *   Mongo Repositories (e.g., for `ApiDetail` and `ApiResponse`).
        *   Service layer component(s) (`ApiService`, `ApiInvocationService`, etc.) responsible for scheduling, orchestrating calls, handling data transformation, saving to MongoDB, and producing to Kafka.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Use dependency injection (`@Autowired`, `@RequiredArgsConstructor`, or constructor injection).
    *   Handle exceptions (e.g., API request failures, database errors) appropriately within service methods.
    *   Apply asynchronous communication where appropriate (using `WebClient.get().retrieve().bodyToFlux`).
    *   Use Spring's `ApplicationProperties` for configuration.
    *   Include clear and concise comments explaining the logic and purpose of different code sections.

Each shipment will contain multiple products. Additionally, each shipment will have a shipment number, a ship date, and the company it is from/to.",False,65551,"Generate a C# console application demonstrating a basic inventory scanning system for managing inbound and outbound shipments. The system must simulate tracking products via their unique serial numbers.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Data Structures:** Define appropriate C# classes (e.g., `Shipment`, `ShipmentItem`, `Product`) to represent the following data:
    *   `Shipment`: Requires `ShipmentNumber` (string), `ShipDate` (DateTime), `CompanyName` (string - sender/receiver), and a collection of `ShipmentItem` objects.
    *   `ShipmentItem`: Contains the `Product` (object), and the `Quantity` (int).
    *   `Product`: Contains a `SerialNumber` (string). Assume each serial number uniquely identifies a product.

2.  **Inbound Shipment Tracking:** Implement a `ScanInboundShipment` function.
    *   **Input:** `CompanyName` (string), `ShipDate` (DateTime), `ShipmentNumber` (string), `SerialNumberList` (List<string> representing scanned items).
    *   **Action:** Create a new `Shipment` object. Iterate through `SerialNumberList`. For each unique `SerialNumber`, create or update its corresponding `Product` object and add a new `ShipmentItem` to the `Shipment` object. The quantity for each `ShipmentItem` should be derived from how many times the serial number appeared in `SerialNumberList`.
    *   **Output:** Returns the newly created `Shipment` object.

3.  **Outbound Shipment Tracking:** Implement a `CreateOutboundShipment` function.
    *   **Input:** `CompanyName` (string), `ShipDate` (DateTime), `ShipmentNumber` (string), `ProductSerialNumbers` (List<string> representing serial numbers for items leaving).
    *   **Action:** Create a new `Shipment` object. Iterate through `ProductSerialNumbers`. For each unique `SerialNumber`, create or locate its corresponding `Product` object and add a new `ShipmentItem` to the `Shipment` object. Calculate the correct `Quantity` for each `ShipmentItem` from how many times its `SerialNumber` appeared in `ProductSerialNumbers`.
    *   **Output:** Returns the newly created `Shipment` object.

4.  **Database Simulation:** For persistence, use a simple `List<Shipment>` to store the shipments and a `List<Product>` to simulate a product database. Populate these lists with some example `Product` and `Shipment` data within the `Main` function.

5.  **User Interface (Console):**
    *   Provide basic console interaction (e.g., input prompts) for adding inbound and outbound shipments (simulating scanning the `SerialNumberList` for inbound or entering `ProductSerialNumbers` for outbound).
    *   After each entry, display a confirmation message showing the created `ShipmentNumber` and the quantity per serial number in the shipment.
    *   Allow the user to optionally view the complete list of shipments logged so far.

6.  **Code Quality:** The code should be well-structured, include comments explaining major logic blocks, and use appropriate C# naming conventions.

**Constraints:**

*   Focus primarily on the core logic for creating and tracking shipments based on serial numbers.
*   Keep the console UI interaction minimal and straightforward.
*   Do not implement file I/O, database integration, or advanced features beyond the core requirements."

Dear Elisabeth,

Thank you. I'm looking through the requirements and the application. It says it takes ""at least"" two weeks - do you have any idea if it will be 2 weeks or longer? 
According to the Consult Gerneral in US, it said nornmally it will only take 4 work days. Although this is a very old post but I looked through the website and did not see they post any new annoucement about the processing time, so I think this annoucement is still valid. However, I think Chinese Embassy are a bit strict these days so may take more time to get a visa than usual. (Adeh took 2-3 monthes to apply for a reunion visa for his son Yaoyao last year which is super annoying)


For me, which is better? To use my US passport or my Dutch passport?
The only doable visa for both of you are Business visa, so please do business visa for yourself too. I think it does not matter which passport you use.

Did you hear anything from the recipient bank about this having been returned?

I checked with the bank twice last week, they said there is only one payment (5980usd) was transferred to your CMB account during the past one month. 


Oh! That’s probably easiest. @xurry would that work? To which address should I send it? 
Xurry and I just talked, the trouble we have to receive money from you is all because of Panama. So the easiest way to do is you transfer USD to Adeh's US bank account, then Adeh using his US bank account to transfer money to my China Bank account. Xurry is using David's paypal, so maybe it would be best if we don't need to involve David in.

Dear Adeh and Ulrich, could you please see if this work fine with you guys?



I ended up being able to cancel the $4000 recurring transfer, and don’t see any evidence that any $4000 transfers actually went out. 

CATHY: OK, Thanks for checking, I just wanna mask sure the $4000 is trackable.

Did you hear anything from the recipient bank about this having been returned? 
I’m 90% sure it was never sent. 


Meanwhile, apparently the $6000 transfers was returned, and the $5980 one was not returned so you should have received that. 

CATHY: Correct, we have received the $5980 payment, and this is the only one payment we received so far.

Ok, great. 


I that consistent with what you know? Any money in limbo still? 

CATHY: Yes. The balance is around 20,000RMB now, but we will need at least 10,000RMB more to cover the expense this month. 

And, how do I send more now? 

CATHY: Can we try paypal? @Xurry

Oh! That’s probably easiest. @xurry would that work? To which address should I send it?

Dear Boss,

We have received the first ppayment, which is 5980usd to your CMB account yesterday, so we should be OK for the next half month. 

Besides, current status for the rest of the two payments:
1. Second payment, 4000usd to your cmb account, on the way, the bank will let me know;
2. Third payment to Xurry, the bank still rejected the payment though Xurry tried her best to proof. She may have or will ask the bank to return it these two days.

Thnaks for your kindly help for the payment, and since we got the first 5980usd, we will have more time to figure out how to transfer money to China. In my opinion, maybe you pay usd to Adeh then Adeh give us CNY is the easiest way if Adeh feel no trouble.

Dear ELisabeth,

According to China Consulate Gerneral in NewYork, at the current stage, multi-year multiple-entry visas issued before March 26, 2020 are still suspended of use. 
So both you and Ulrich will need to apply for a new business visa. (so far the easiest one)
Here is the lastest China visa application instructions: http://newyork.china-consulate.gov.cn/eng/tzgg/202301/t20230109_11004155.htm
According the link above, kudelabs will need to offer you two invitation letters for business visa. We wll make them next Monday and send them back to you.

Have a nice day!

Cathy


Thank you! 
What is involved in getting a work visa for Ulrich to enter? 
I still have my 10-year business visa that I got before the pandemic, but I think Ulrich's is expired. Do you know if that still works?

Glad to hear it! By the way, is it true that there are no longer covid restrictions for entering China? Could you let us know what the rules are these days; if it's open again then we will plan to come back very soon.

I tested it out. See attachment.
Exchange rate 7.137 is the best if I go to the counter to pick up the money, estimated fee is 0 for some reason(maybe they took a little bit exchange rate profit there).

Did you hear anything from the recipient bank about this having been returned? 
I’m 90% sure it was never sent.
I checked with the bank twice last week, they said there is only one payment (5980usd) was transferred to your CMB account during the past one month. 


Oh! That’s probably easiest. @xurry would that work? To which address should I send it? 
Xurry and I just talked, the trouble we have to receive money from you is all because of Panama. So the easiest way to do is you transfer USD to Adeh's US bank account, then Adeh using his US bank account to transfer money to my China Bank account. Xurry is using David's paypal, so maybe it would be best if we don't need to involve David in.

Dear Adeh and Ulrich, could you please see if this work fine with you guys?



I ended up being able to cancel the $4000 recurring transfer, and don’t see any evidence that any $4000 transfers actually went out. 

CATHY: OK, Thanks for checking, I just wanna mask sure the $4000 is trackable.

Did you hear anything from the recipient bank about this having been returned? 
I’m 90% sure it was never sent. 


Meanwhile, apparently the $6000 transfers was returned, and the $5980 one was not returned so you should have received that. 

CATHY: Correct, we have received the $5980 payment, and this is the only one payment we received so far.

Ok, great. 


I that consistent with what you know? Any money in limbo still? 

CATHY: Yes. The balance is around 20,000RMB now, but we will need at least 10,000RMB more to cover the expense this month. 

And, how do I send more now? 

CATHY: Can we try paypal? @Xurry

Oh! That’s probably easiest. @xurry would that work? To which address should I send it? 



Thanks for your patience. What a mess!

Dear Ulrich,

I just called CMB to check your second payment to your CMB account(4000USD), and the bank said they still have not received it. 
Please check and see if the payment is automatically refund to your HSBC account, and we will need to figure out the way to transfer money to Kude before the end of this month.

So far, we only receivd the first 6000USD to your CMB account, the third payment to Xurry is refunded, please also check if it has arrived or not.

Thank you so much!

Dear Boss,

We have received the first ppayment, which is 5980usd to your CMB account yesterday, so we should be OK for the next half month. 

Besides, current status for the rest of the two payments:
1. Second payment, 4000usd to your cmb account, on the way, the bank will let me know;
2. Third payment to Xurry, the bank still rejected the payment though Xurry tried her best to proof. She may have or will ask the bank to return it these two days.

Thnaks for your kindly help for the payment, and since we got the first 5980usd, we will have more time to figure out how to transfer money to China. In my opinion, maybe you pay usd to Adeh then Adeh give us CNY is the easiest way if Adeh feel no trouble.

And now, Chinese banks won’t accept wires from me any more.

The state is represented by a 3 by 3 matrix of values from 1 to 8, and an empty slot. At every state, we may take a number adjacent to the empty slot, and swap the two. The goal is to get from a random initial state to one where the numbers are sorted in order, and the empty slot is in the bottom right.",True,75539,"Act as an expert algorithm designer specializing in search algorithms. Your task is to outline the key concepts and criteria for assessing the efficacy of a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically for solving the 8-puzzle sliding tile problem.

**Provide a comprehensive discussion addressing the following points:**

1.  **LLM Capability Analysis:** Detail the specific challenges posed by the 8-puzzle (e.g., identifying and exploring optimal move sequences, avoiding loops) and analyze the types of LLM strengths that might be beneficial in addressing these challenges (e.g., pattern recognition, strategic planning).

2.  **Problem Representation Strategies:** Discuss potential methods for representing the 8-puzzle problem (states, actions) to the LLM. Analyze the pros and cons of different approaches, considering LLM token limits, reasoning complexity, and clarity for the model (e.g., simple numerical arrays, grid diagrams, descriptive move instructions).

3.  **Search Algorithm Emulation:** Outline how an LLM could potentially mimic or approximate classical search algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, A*) for the 8-puzzle. Explain the mapping between search components (state space, operators, goal test) and LLM functions (input transformation, action generation/selection, evaluation logic via prompts/token generation).

4.  **Evaluation Framework:** Suggest a clear, unbiased framework for evaluating the LLM's performance. Specify suitable metrics (e.g., solve rate, move count/path cost relative to optimal solutions, computation time), evaluation methods (e.g., solving a set of diverse random start states), and criteria to compare performance across different LLM setups, reasoning methods, and input encodings.

5.  **Reasoning Approaches to Encourage:** Suggest specific prompting techniques or reasoning strategies that could improve the LLM's problem-solving behavior for the 8-puzzle. Examples include:
    *   Chain-of-thought prompting to guide the reasoning process.
    *   Goal-driven prompts to maintain focus on the sorted state.
    *   Constraint-based prompting to enforce valid moves and prevent cycles."

2.  `create_sqlalchemy_engine()`: Creates and stores an SQLAlchemy engine object using the `psycopg2` dialect.
3.  `execute_sql(sql_query, params=None, commit=False, session=None)`: Executes arbitrary raw SQL queries (using `psycopg2`).
    *   `sql_query`: The SQL string.
    *   `params`: (Optional) Parameters for parameterized queries (e.g., for `%s` placeholders).
    *   `commit`: (Optional) If `True`, commit the transaction after execution.
    *   `session`: (Optional) If provided, execute the query within an SQLAlchemy session.

*   **Output Format:** Methods should return appropriate results (e.g., fetched data, affected row count).
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for database operations and return `None` upon failure.
*   **Transaction Management:** Ensure transactional integrity through the `psycopg2` connection, handling commits and rollbacks appropriately. Methods operating within an SQLAlchemy context should leverage its transaction management.
*   **Modularity & Clarity:** The class structure and method implementations must be well-organized, clean, and easy to understand. Include clear docstrings for each method explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value."

Your goal is to collaboratively develop a personalized plan to help me overcome the challenge of maintaining a healthy sleep schedule, where I go to bed consistently early and wake up early feeling refreshed, especially addressing the late-night distractions from videos and games.

To create this plan, please guide me through the following steps:

1.  **Comprehensive Self-Assessment:** Ask insightful questions about my current sleep habits, circadian rhythm tendencies, screen time routines (especially before bed), environmental sleep factors (bedroom setup, light/noise exposure), diet/exercise patterns, and any underlying mental health considerations (anxiety, stress, etc.).
2.  **Identify Underlying Barriers & Motivators:** Help me pinpoint the root causes behind my current bedtime procrastination (e.g., fear of missing out, lack of structure, boredom, digital addiction, stress management). Explore my core motivations for wanting to change.
3.  **Prioritize Goal Setting:** Co-create specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals, starting with incremental steps towards an earlier and more consistent bedtime and wake-up time.
4.  **Develop Personalized Sleep Hygiene Strategies:** Based on my assessment and goals, provide tailored actionable strategies for improving my sleep routine and environment. Focus on areas like:
    *   Consistent wake and sleep times, even on weekends
    *   Pre-sleep rituals (e.g., relaxing routines like reading, warm baths, meditation)
    *   Optimal screen time management (strategies for putting away devices before bed and resisting the urge to check them late at night)
    *   Improving sleep environment (temperature, darkness, quiet)
    *   Establishing healthy daytime habits that support sleep (e.g., regular exercise, balanced diet, sufficient sunlight exposure)
    *   Mindfulness and stress-reduction techniques
5.  **Outline a Practical Implementation Plan:** Structure these strategies into a phased plan, offering step-by-step guidance for gradual implementation over time. Suggest tools (e.g., digital clocks, sleep trackers) or techniques (e.g., positive reinforcement, accountability methods) to support adherence.
6.  **Provide Ongoing Support & Contingency Planning:** Address potential challenges like setbacks, resistance to change, and common obstacles (e.g., social events, travel). Offer encouragement and suggestions for staying committed long-term.

My objective is to receive a clear, actionable, and personalized plan that empowers me to establish and maintain a healthy, consistent sleep schedule. Please engage with me actively, asking relevant follow-up questions to tailor the advice effectively."

Much attention has been directed toward China’s high savings rate (Broda et al. 2009, Prasad 2009, Reisen 2009). Not only is the savings rate disproportionately high compared to virtually any other country, but it directly impacts China’s current account surplus and the US consumer debt and trade deficit. When national savings exceeds investment, the excess savings becomes China’s current account surplus.

Given its far-reaching effects, both private sector analysts and policymakers have attempted to trace the causes of China’s high savings rate and to predict how long it will last. Some have attributed the savings primarily to Chinese corporations. Others point to a precautionary savings motive – as Chinese are worried about costs of healthcare, education, and old-age pensions and are unsure about how much these costs might change over time, they save more.

But these explanations may not be the most important part of the story. For example, while the Chinese corporate savings rate is high, the pattern is consistent with many countries. For example, Korea and Japan always have an even higher corporate savings rate than China. In fact, corporate savings rates in most countries have experienced a steady rise in the recent decades. In research with Tam Bayoumi and Hui Tong (2009), we show that to understand why China’s national savings rate is so high, the corporate sector is the wrong place to start.

A marriage proposal
It is the high Chinese household savings that has no equal among major economies. As to explanations related to poor social safety net, they have trouble being reconciled with the improvements in the pension system, health insurance, and other government programs in recent years. Yes, the Chinese social safety net is still poor. Yes, part of the Chinese savings is to make up for the inadequacy of the social safety net. Yes, there may be some increase in the cost of healthcare. But, as the social safety has improved and the insurance coverage has expanded over the last decade or so, we should expect household savings to decline, or at least not increase. Yet, household savings as a share of disposable income almost doubled from 16% in 1990 to over 30% today.

In my recent research paper with Xiaobo Zhang (Wei and Zhang 2009), we hypothesised that a social phenomenon is the primary driver of the high savings rate. For the last few decades China has experienced a significant rise in the imbalance between the number of male and female children born to its citizens.

There are approximately 122 boys born for every 100 girls today, a ratio that means about one in five Chinese men will be cut out of the marriage market when this generation of children grows up. A variety of factors conspire to produce the imbalance. For example, Chinese parents often prefer sons. Ultra-sound makes it easy for parents to detect the gender of a foetus and abort the child that’s not the “right” sex for them, especially as China’s stringent family-planning policy allows most couples to have only one or two children.

Our study compared savings data across regions and in households with sons versus those with daughters. We found that not only did households with sons save more than households with daughters on average, but that households with sons tend to raise their savings rate if they also happen to live in a region with a more skewed gender ratio. Even those not competing in the marriage market must compete to buy housing and make other significant purchases, pushing up the savings rate for all households.

Cross-regional evidence
In Figure 1, we have plotted the time series of the (standardised) Chinese private sector savings rate (in red), defined as GDP less private and government consumption over GDP, from 1975 to 2005 against the (standardised) gender ratio at birth lagged by twenty years (i.e., 1955-1985) (in blue). There is a strikingly close connection between the two variables. The savings rate started to shoot up around 2002 just as the gender ratio for the marriage-age cohort began to be seriously out of balance. We show that this is more than a coincidence.

First, in panel regressions across 30 Chinese provinces during 1990-2007, the local savings rate tends to be higher in regions and years in which the local gender ratio is higher. This continues to be true after we control for local income level, income inequality, the enrolment in the social security system, the age profile of the local population, and the province and year fixed effects.
Second, we recognise possible endogeneity of, and measurement error in, local gender ratios, and employ an instrumental approach. Gender ratio imbalance comes primarily from sex-selective abortions. This, in turn, results from a combination of parental preference for sons, and some limit to the number of children a couple is allowed or wants to have (which for the Chinese is a strict family-planning policy).

As suggested by other scholars, we use two measures of local financial penalties for violating family-planning policies – set more than a decade earlier – as instrumental variables for local gender ratio imbalance for the pre-marriage age cohort. As an extension, we also add the fraction of the local population that is legally exempted from the family-planning policy as an additional instrument. With either set of instruments, the effect of local gender ratios on local savings rates remains positive and statistically significant. In fact, the point estimate becomes larger. This suggests that an increasing imbalance in the gender ratio causes a rise in the savings rate.

Based on the point estimate in the instrumental regression, a rise in the gender ratio for the pre-marital age cohort from 1.05 to 1.14 (which is the mean increase across the provinces from 1990-2007) would lead to a rise in the savings rate by 6.7 percentage points, which is about 42% of the actual increase in the savings rate. If we run separate regressions for rural and urban areas, we find that the elasticity of the local savings rate with respect to the local gender ratio is larger in rural areas than in urban areas. An increase in the local gender ratio from 1.05 to 1.14 in the rural areas (the actual mean increase from 1990 to 2007) could account for about 49% of the actual increase in the savings rate.

Household-level evidence
We then examine household data using household surveys that cover 122 rural counties and 70 cities in 2002. While households with a son typically save more than households with a daughter, we do not regard this per se as supportive evidence of our hypothesis, since other channels could account for this difference. Instead, the evidence that we find more compelling is that savings by otherwise identical households with a son are greater in regions with a higher local gender ratio. This is something clearly predicted by our hypothesis, but not by any other existing explanations. In addition, we find that savings by households with a daughter do not decline in regions with a high gender ratio. This is consistent with the possibility pointed out in the model that the two opposing effects approximately cancel each other out. It is also consistent with the possibility that the savings pressure on households with a son spills over to other types of households.

With household-level data, we can control for a variety of household features that allow us to measure the importance of lifecycle factors (e.g., the age structure of the family members) and the precautionary savings motive (education level of the household head, whether any member of the household works in a government sector, has lost a job, or has experienced major illness). We find no robust support for the lifecycle hypothesis and some support for the precautionary savings motive. Indeed, the quantitative effect of a rise in the gender ratio on the savings rate is unaffected by controlling for these factors.

Still, could the local gender ratio reflect some omitted or unobserved variables that also affect the household savings decision? One may imagine that a region with more intrinsic income uncertainty, or a greater local aversion to a given uncertainty, may simultaneously exhibit a higher local gender ratio imbalance and a higher local savings rate. Can we rule this out? Yes. A pure location-specific shock should affect savings by all households in the same region in the same way. But that is not what we find. Instead, only the savings by those households with a son react strongly and positively to a rise in the local gender ratio, while savings by households with a daughter do not.

The next possibility is far more challenging. Could a gender ratio imbalance reflect something that is both location and household specific? For example, a region may have an unusually high level of income uncertainty that is common to all households, but some households care about this more than others. Those with a stronger aversion to uncertainty may engage in a sex-selective abortion more aggressively and save more at the same time. By construction, selection at both household and location level is much harder to rule out since our unit of observation is at the same level. But there are good reasons to think that if we focus on households with a single child, such selection is unlikely to be quantitatively significant. Ebenstein (2009) shows that gender ratio imbalance is overwhelmingly a result of sex-selective abortions at higher orders of birth. That is, the gender ratio for first-born children is close to normal. This is particularly true in rural areas. 

Since a second child is officially permitted if the first child is a girl, and since many families exhibit a preference for a balanced gender ratio (one boy and one girl) over having two boys, there is very little reason to perform sex-selective abortions on the first pregnancy. However, the gender ratio at birth goes up substantially over time for the second-born children and becomes even more skewed for higher order births. This pattern is also pointed out by Zhu, Lu and Hesketh (2009) in an article in the British Medical Journal. This suggests that the first son (or daughter) is unlikely to result from a sex-selective abortion. In our empirical examination, when we restrict attention to households with only one child, we still see that those with a son exhibit a strongly positive elasticity of savings with respect to the local gender ratio, but those with a daughter do not. Furthermore, savings by a household with a son are more sensitive to the gender ratio in rural areas.

Policy implications
While the conventional explanations for the high savings rate all play a role, this new research indicates those explanations are not as important as people previously thought. While sociologists and other social scientists have looked at the gender ratio imbalance as a social problem, they have not looked at it in relation to the high Chinese savings rate. Similarly, as economists and policymakers have looked with concern to the large Chinese current account surplus and large US current account deficit, or global imbalances, much of their discussion has focused on changing exchange rate policy.
None of the discussion about global imbalances has brought family-planning policy or women’s rights to the table, because many do not see these issues as related to economic policy. Our research suggests that this is a serious omission. You can only implement the right policy when you have the appropriate diagnosis, and fruitful policy dialogue has to include discussion on these issues.

**Character Details & Narrative Structure:**

*   **Irie:** An imaginative 4-year-old girl who initially dislikes chores.
*   **Elder Plant (e.g., a Talking Fig Tree):** Provide a detailed description. This plant is very wise, patient, and speaks calmly. Its teaching style relies on relating Irie's chore struggles to its own experiences or that of its family/community, offering concrete, relatable analogies.

Its teaching style is similar to the plant, focusing on personal anecdotes and real-life examples relevant to Irie's experience (e.g., taking care of baby elephants, contributing to the herd, finding solutions with family/herd).

**Plot Breakdown & Requirements:**

1.  **Irie's Struggle:** The story begins with Irie avoiding or complaining about her chores (e.g., putting away toys, helping set the table, tidying her room). She expresses her dislike.
2.  **The Lesson Begins:** Irie seeks refuge or complains near the wise Elder Plant. The plant doesn't directly scold her, but observes her struggle and shares a simple analogy or story (e.g., how roots hold the tree firm even when young, or how a young leaf helping keep the plant clean leads to it shining brightly).
3.  **The Elephant's Wisdom:** Later, Irie feels more down. She seeks out the wise Elephant for comfort or plays nearby. The Elephant, sensing her sadness, provides a related, heartwarming story (e.g., how baby elephants learn to carry logs together or how a young elephant finding a water source helps the whole herd).
4.  **Irie Tries:** Inspired (perhaps initially reluctantly) by the Plant and Elephant's stories, Irie attempts a small chore with a new perspective or tries adapting the lessons from the stories to her own situation.
5.  **Positive Outcomes:**
    *   The chores become easier or less unpleasant.
    *   Irie experiences a sense of accomplishment and pride.

**Your Task:**
Convert the provided HTML `<table>` element into an equivalent `ant-design/pro-table` component, incorporating specific customization requirements.

**Input HTML Table:**
The provided HTML `<table>` element represents a simple table structure with:
-   A header row containing 'Block' and multiple 'Buyer' titles.
-   Body rows where the first column indicates a 'Block' value, and the subsequent columns are designated for 'Buyer' data.
-   The cell content within the Buyer columns is represented by the placeholder string `{editableCell}`.

**Output Component Requirements:**
1.  **Data Structure:** Assume the input data source will be an array of objects, where each object represents a row. Each object should contain a 'Block' key and keys matching the 'Buyer' headers (e.g., 'SEAL', 'COP').
2.  **Rendering Logic:**
    -   The component must use the `ProTable` from `ant-design/pro-table`.
    -   The first column must display the 'Block' value, using `dataIndex: 'Block'`.
    -   For each 'Buyer' column, create an `antd.ColumnProps` configuration using `dataIndex` for the 'Buyer' header value.
    -   **Critically**, the columns corresponding to the `{editableCell}` placeholders must render as editable Antd fields, using an `antd.Form.Item` wrapped around the `ProTable.ColumnTitle` and controlled by the table's `form`. Use the `renderTextCell` and `renderCell` props on the column config to integrate these fields.
3.  **State Management:** Manage the editable cell values within the `ProTable` itself, using the `form` prop.
4.  **Appearance:** Match the default Ant Design ProTable styling. Include the default features like filtering or pagination if necessary.

**Assume:**
-   You have access to all necessary Ant Design and `ant-design/pro-table` components and hooks (e.g., `ProTable`, `ProTable.ColumnTitle`, `antd.Form`, `antd.Form.Item`).
-   The data source will be provided separately and passed to the `ProTable`'s `dataSource` prop.

**Present:**
-   The complete React.js source code for the Ant Design `ProTable` component, including the column configurations and `renderCell` logic for editable cells.

3.  **Hook Output:** The hook's primary output should be a function (likely called `triggerNotification` or `showNotification`) that, when invoked, receives the necessary notification configuration and then calls the `notify` helper function (or its equivalent internal logic).
4.  **Context Integration:** Internally, the hook must correctly use `useContext` with the appropriate context (`NotificationContext`) to retrieve the notification element needed to trigger the notification.
5.  **Error Handling:** Ensure the hook includes basic checks and handles potential errors related to the context element (e.g., if it's null).
6.  **Helper Function Compatibility:** The hook should ideally use the original `notify` helper function directly (assuming it's exported) to trigger the notification.

**Deliverable:**

This script should perform the following actions iteratively for each file found matching a given filename pattern:
1.  **File Targeting:** Use `FOR /R ""%ROOT_DIRECTORY%"" %I IN (""%FILE_PATTERN%"") DO` to recursively search within `%ROOT_DIRECTORY%` and its subdirectories for files matching `%FILE_PATTERN%` (e.g., `*.txt`, `log_*.dat`).
2.  **External Program Call:** Within the loop (`DO (...)`), execute an external program with the full path to the current target file, represented by `%~fI`, as its argument. For example: `%EXTERNAL_PROGRAM_PATH% ""%~fI""`
3.  **Completion Check:** After calling the external program, wait until its process is complete using `%PROCESS_WAIT_COMMAND% %ERRORLEVEL%`, replacing `%PROCESS_WAIT_COMMAND%` with the appropriate Windows command (e.g., `waitfor /t -1 processComplete %ERRORLEVEL%`, or use `if errorlevel 1 timeout /t 5 > nul`).
4.  **Rename with Suffix:** Once the program finishes (confirmed by waiting), rename the original file using the format `basename`.`suffix`.`extension`. Use `%~nxI` for the base filename and `%suffix%` for the specified suffix (e.g., rename `log_2023-10-27.dat` to `log_2023-10-27.processed.dat`). Ensure the script handles spaces in directory names, filenames, and suffix.
5.  **Echo Success:** Display a message to the console indicating which file was processed and renamed.

Include placeholders for user-definable variables like:
*   `%ROOT_DIRECTORY%` (e.g., `C:\MyFiles`)
*   `%FILE_PATTERN%` (e.g., `log_*.dat`)
*   `%EXTERNAL_PROGRAM_PATH%` (e.g., `""C:\Path\To\MyProgram.exe""`)
*   `%suffix%` (e.g., `.processed`)
*   `%PROCESS_WAIT_COMMAND%` (e.g., `waitfor /t -1 processComplete %ERRORLEVEL%`)

1.  **Input:** Define a simple set of command-line options (e.g., `-a <argument1>`, `-b <argument2>`, `-c <argument3>`).
2.  **`getopts` Parsing Loop:** Implement a `while getopts` loop to process the options.
3.  **Option Handling:** Include `case ... esac` logic to handle different option types:
    *   `:<option>:`: Handle options *with* required arguments. Store the argument in a variable like `optarg`.
    *   `?`: Handle unknown options and print an error message (e.g., using `echo`) before continuing.
    *   `:`: (Optional) Handle missing option arguments. Print an error message.
4.  **`shift` Operation:** Show how to use `shift $(($OPTIND - 1))` *after* the loop to process non-option arguments that might follow the defined options.
5.  **Argument Reuse (Key Feature):** The requirement is to make the *first* `optarg` (the value passed to the first option encountered, e.g., `-a value1`) reusable for subsequent options that *don't* have their own arguments. For instance, if the script runs as `my_script -a value1 -b -c`, options `-b` and `-c` should internally reuse `value1` for their arguments.

**Script Characteristics:**

*   Use clear, commented Bash code for demonstration.
*   Employ modern Bash practices (e.g., `${parameter}` substitution, `""$@` use).
*   Avoid older deprecated syntax like `$`()` for parameter expansion.
*   The script should handle variable scope correctly (e.g., using `local` for temporary variables within functions, correctly referencing globally declared variables where necessary).
*   The script should print the parsed options, their values (including the reused argument), and any non-option arguments to standard output."

It should include functionality for defining replication and flexible cluster topologies with operator control over partitioning and replication scheduling. Write the code for this database in Rust.,False,24565,"Act as an expert Rust developer specializing in database systems and distributed computing. Your task is to design and implement a multi-node, columnar, time-series database in Rust. This database should adhere strictly to the following specifications:

**Core Architecture:**

1.  **Persistent Storage:** Utilize Parquet for persistent data storage. Implement efficient encoding and compression strategies within the Parquet files to optimize both disk I/O and storage footprint for time-series data.
2.  **In-Memory Processing:** Employ Apache Arrow as the primary columnar memory representation. Ensure efficient conversion between Parquet columnar data and Arrow's `ChunkedArray`/`RecordBatch` structures.
3.  **Query Engine:** Design a time-series query engine that can perform aggregation, filtering, and point-in-time lookups directly on Arrow buffers in memory, optionally retrieving data from Parquet files on demand. Support common time functions (e.g., sliding window averages, rate calculations).

**Data Ingestion & Replication:**

1.  **Ingestion Protocol:** Define a gRPC protocol (`.proto` definitions) for efficiently ingesting data into the system.
2.  **Replication:** Implement robust data replication logic. Support:
    *   Configurable replication factors (e.g., RF=3).
    *   Mechanisms for managing data consistency (potentially utilizing vector clocks or Raft).
    *   Conflict resolution strategies if data conflicts occur between replicas.

**Distribution & Clustering:**

1.  **Architecture:** The database must be designed to run as a distributed system across multiple nodes.
2.  **Topology Management:** Implement a node discovery mechanism (e.g., using gRPC Health Checks or custom heartbeats) to maintain an internal view of cluster membership.
3.  **Partitioning:** Design and implement a flexible partitioning strategy. This should include:
    *   Support for partitioning by specific time ranges (e.g., hourly, daily, monthly).
    *   Ability to configure partitioning schemes per time-series.
4.  **Replication Scheduling:** Develop an operator interface (e.g., via gRPC) allowing control over replication scheduling. This interface should enable manual adjustments to replication factors for specific time-series or partition keys.

**Implementation Details:**

*   Use Rust 2021 or later and include a `Cargo.toml`.
*   Structure the codebase logically into crates (e.g., `tsdb-core`, `tsdb-replication`, `tsdb-storage`, `tsdb-ingestion`, `tsdb-query`).
*   Provide clear documentation, including a high-level architecture overview and explanations for key components and design decisions.
*   Include basic unit tests to demonstrate core functionalities (data ingestion, point query, replication).

**Output:**

1.  A clear, commented, and logically structured Rust codebase implementing the described time-series database system.
2.  The gRPC `.proto` definition for the ingestion protocol.
3.  Basic documentation and unit tests.

write code for a user script to set up a aws ec2 instance to create a web server running a react application with a python and django backend,,write code for a user script to set up a aws ec2 instance to create a web server running a react application with a python and django backend,False,50167,"Generate a comprehensive EC2 setup script using BASH and the AWS CLI, designed to configure a single Amazon Linux 2 instance as a multi-tier web application server. This script should accomplish the following tasks in sequence:

1.  **Security Setup:**
    *   Configure `iptables` to allow SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80), and HTTPS (port 443) traffic.
    *   Configure AWS EC2 Instance Security Groups (within the `aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress` API call) to permit the above TCP ports (22, 80, 443) for inbound connections. Grant egress to all ports.

2.  **Dependency Installation & Python Environment:**
    *   Install `python3`, `python3-pip`, `git`, `nginx`, `certbot`.
    *   Create and activate a virtual environment for Python dependencies (e.g., `.venv` or `venv`).
    *   Install the required Python packages for Django (e.g., Django, gunicorn, psycopg2-binary, Pillow) and React (e.g., npm, Node.js) within the activated virtual environment.

3.  **Backend Configuration (Python/Django):**
    *   Assume a Django project named `my_backend_project` is cloned into `/var/www/my_backend_project` using `git`.
    *   Create a `settings.py` file in the Django project directory. Set `DEBUG = False`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']`, and configure the `DATABASES` connection string to use SQLite (if no separate database setup is requested) or point to a specific database URL (if separate database setup logic is defined). Include any other essential Django project-specific configurations (e.g., `TIME_ZONE`).
    *   Create, migrate, and collect static files (in production mode) within the virtual environment, configuring `STATIC_ROOT` and `MEDIA_ROOT`.

4.  **Backend Server Setup (gunicorn):**
    *   Create a gunicorn `systemd` service file (e.g., `gunicorn_my_backend_project.service`) for the Django backend, configured to:
        *   Run as the `www-data` user.
        *   Execute the Gunicorn command within the activated virtual environment and the Django project directory (e.g., `gunicorn my_backend_project.wsgi --bind 0.0.0.0:8000`).
    *   Enable and start the gunicorn service using `systemctl`.

5.  **Frontend Deployment (React):**
    *   Assume the React application is cloned into `/var/www/my_react_app` using `git`.
    *   Assume you can build the React application into a production-ready static site within the project's directory (e.g., via `npm run build`). Configure build/output paths as needed.
    *   Move the generated static assets (typically in a `build` directory within the React app) to a serving directory within the instance (e.g., `/var/www/html/react_app`).

6.  **Web Server (nginx) Configuration:**
    *   Create or modify the Nginx configuration file for the React app and Django backend (e.g., `/etc/nginx/conf.d/my_webapp.conf`). Implement a configuration that:
        *   Serves the React application's static files directly from `/var/www/html/react_app` for requests matching `/` (fallback to `index.html` within that directory).
        *   Proxies all requests to the backend API endpoints (e.g., `/api/`) to the running Gunicorn service at `http://127.0.0.4000` (use `http://127.0.0.1:8000` if necessary, ensuring `LISTEN_ADDRESS` is properly set in `gunicorn_my_backend_project.service`).
        *   Correctly handles static and media file serving for the Django backend (potentially serving directly or proxied depending on needs).

7.  **Obtain SSL/TLS Certificates (certbot):**
    *   Obtain SSL/TLS certificates using `certbot` for the instance's public domain name (configured for the EC2 instance's IP address). Install the certificates within Nginx.
    *   Ensure Nginx automatically uses these certificates.

8.  **Finalization:**
    *   Reboot or reload necessary services (e.g., `nginx`, `systemd gunicorn`).
    *   Ensure all services (nginx, gunicorn) are running and started automatically on system boot.

Ensure the script is well-commented and logically organized, covering both command execution and any necessary file creation/modification with clear explanations."

They see enemies on the horizon and fear what marvels they’ve unearthed.

=== Noble Races (Create societies/social structure): ===
* Human
**	People of the Cloud - Worship the sky/air, closest thing to the sky are the clouds.
**	Midlanders - Hearty, farming and industrial people. 
**	Highlanders - Warlike, small bands that keep to their own circle 
* Dwarf
* High Elf
* Vulcans = Volcano People- hot rock people
* Feyleaf = Plant People
* Beastmen = Animal-people

=== Neutral Races (Self Interested - old): ===
* Fey = Animalistic/humanistic
* Construct

* Players can choose a character from three playable races: Humans, Dwarves, and Elves.
* The player character will hail from a walk of life in a land where most people do not know about the greater world. They do not speak of the name of the world or contintent, nor do they know the lay of its land. They only know the names of mountains, and cities, and rivers.
* There is conflict between the three playable races. Each race is an important faction. There may be smaller factions within each race, or even across races, but it is unusual. The factions exploit each other and have a delicate balance of power. They dislike each other but find they must live with each other.
* Dwarves are exploited for their labor. Humans pursue control through conquest.
* Dwarves drink ale and would make their own destiny if they could.
* Woodcutting is an important profession amongst humans.
* The world has bandits in it, and nefarious types from every race. The players come across these, but those conflicts hopefully don't end in killing.
* When most people think of the enemy, they think of monsters and monstrous beings: the kinds of creatures that go bump in the night or live in deep dark caves. The players must fight these creatures and kill them.
* The player characters may also occasionally fight other races, and that should be especially interesting, thematic, and suspenseful.
* Dialog should contain suspense and indecision.
* The story should be told from the point of view of the protagonist.
* The protagonist is a strong female protagonist, and her name is Clara.
* Clara is a warrior, and is a good person.
* Clara should be conflicted and be subjected to moral quandries, and deliberate over her choices.
* Clara is a hero.
* The humans are ruled by a king. The human king consorts with dark elves secretly. That is scandalous. He wants something from the dark elves. There is a dark elf ambassador who has the Dragonstone. The dark elves seem to beleive the Dragonstone will let them control the other races.
* One of the major characters is a woodcutter.
* The orcs control a white tower. The orcs are secretly being manipulated by dark elves.



Please tell me an epic, suspenseful story from the perspective of Clara. After the story, Clara will go on to have an epic, long, and world-changing quest. In the story, include lots of foreshadowing of the events that are to come. Involve the woodcutter, orcs, the dark elf ambassador, and the human king in the story.

Article: ""What China can still do to avoid an enormous covid death toll It must treat hospitals as a precious resource and start stockpiling drugs People wearing face masks walk in a subway station, as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks continue in Shanghai, China, December 8, 2022. Testing stations are being removed from city streets. The enforcers of “zero-covid” are nowhere to be found. In China’s battle against covid-19, the state has disappeared from the front lines. For nearly three years President Xi Jinping tried to contain the virus, calling his efforts a “people’s war”. Now he has surrendered and the people must live with the enemy. Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android. Mr Xi is not the first leader to conclude that such a fight was unwinnable. But before ditching their zero-covid policies, other countries first took pains to administer vaccines, stockpile antiviral drugs and draw up treatment guidelines. China had ample time to do all of that. Yet more than two years after the first vaccine proved effective, the country remains ill-prepared. That has made opening up much more dangerous than it ought to be. How dangerous? In this week’s China section we publish our model of how the epidemic might play out. It comes with essential caveats. Modelling an epidemic is difficult. Modelling one in China, where the data are often unreliable, is even harder. We take into account variables such as vaccination rates, the effectiveness of Chinese jabs, the lethality of covid for different age groups and the number of intensive-care beds. In a worst case, if covid spreads freely and many people cannot get care, we estimate that in the coming months 1.5m Chinese people will die from the virus. Although that is a lower share of the population than in many rich countries, it is still a criticism of the government’s poor preparations. It is also a call to action. A vaccination drive will take months. The government has waited too long to build and staff new icus. But even if the state will not impose lockdowns while it prepares, it can mitigate the number of deaths. It should start by protecting the health system. A wave of covid is breaking over China. Our model sees this peaking in January. By that time hospitals risk being overwhelmed. Beds and staff are a precious resource to be husbanded. That means keeping people who are not seriously ill away from hospitals. To that end, the state could help drug companies restock pharmacies that run out of such things as lateral-flow tests and paracetamol. Medical staff should be vaccinated first and they must be given the proper gear to minimise the risk of infection. A second step is to ensure cheap and plentiful supplies of covid drugs. Dexamethasone, a low-priced steroid, has been shown to reduce deaths among the most severely ill patients. Antivirals, such as Paxlovid, help keep those most at risk out of hospital. These drugs have become part of the toolkit doctors around the world are using to fight the virus. They could save many thousands of lives in China. Only the government knows if it has enough of them to go around. If not, it should start stocking up. Foreign governments would surely send supplies if China asked. President Xi Jinping should not let his pride imperil China’s people, as he has done by shunning more efficacious Western vaccines. China’s vaccines still work. So the third priority is to get them into people’s arms. It may be too late for many in this wave, but there will be others. Less than half of those over 80 years old have had three shots, the number needed for decent protection against severe disease and death. Yet some of the elderly have gone to the clinic for a jab only to be turned away for lack of supplies. Until recently, some vaccine factories were sitting idle. Vast quantities will be needed. Six-monthly booster shots ought to become a normal part of life for older Chinese. As the state has failed to do its job, people are helping themselves. Masks are ubiquitous in many cities and more people are working from home. Restaurants and cinemas may be open, but in cities such as Beijing they remain largely empty. All this will help slow the growth of this covid wave and ease the pressure on hospitals. But the government must also act. In a country the size of China, even small steps could save many lives.""

Article: ""How Chinese people are dealing with the spread of covid-19 The government has left the public to fend for itself A elderly man wearing a face mask and goggle walks on a street in Beijing, Sunday, Dec. 11, 2022. Facing a surge in COVID-19 cases, China is setting up more intensive care facilities and trying to strengthen hospitals as Beijing rolls back anti-virus controls that confined millions of people to their homes, crushed economic growth and set off protests. Just a few months ago Chinese people had little fear of catching covid-19. The government’s “zero-covid” measures kept them safe for the most part. Mass testing and strict lockdowns contained the virus. If a person did test positive, the government would swoop in. The infected were taken to state-run quarantine centres. If symptomatic, they were treated in a designated hospital. Health workers would douse their house with disinfectant and test their neighbours. All this changed on December 7th, when the central government largely ditched its zero-covid policy, lifting most restrictions. Six days later it scrapped an app that tracked people’s movements. The highly transmissible Omicron variant had made zero-covid unsustainable. Now the public is expected to fend for itself. “Be the first person responsible for your own health,” wrote the People’s Daily, a Communist Party mouthpiece. Some residents of Beijing have received letters from the local committees that used to enforce covid controls. Stop reporting fevers and coughs to us, one read, before wishing people good luck. “Thank you for the past three years of support and understanding.” The official number of new cases is falling, as if the virus were fading away. But official numbers are no longer reliable because the government has scaled back testing. If it has an alternative way of keeping tabs on the epidemic, it is not sharing it. Still, it is pretty clear that a covid wave is building, as people share stories of infection online. An informal survey has been circulating on social media asking Beijing residents if they have caught the virus. As The Economist went to press, 39% of the 434,000 or so respondents had said yes. Such surveys are striking, not just for the numbers. A few months ago people who had caught covid were stigmatised. They might, for example, struggle to find jobs after recovering. Now the disease is so common that people are posting their test results on social media, often substituting for the word “positive” a cartoon of a sheep (which is a Chinese homophone for positive). Others are sharing lighthearted advice about the best time to catch covid. An infection now or in early January, for example, might clear up in time for a person to enjoy both Christmas and the lunar new year. “Why aren’t I positive yet?” complained one young woman in a video. Others, though, are worried. Until recently the government told people that covid was to be feared. Now the official line is that Omicron is no worse than the flu. Infected people who are not showing serious symptoms have been encouraged to stay at home and treat themselves. Not everyone is listening. Beijing’s emergency-call operators have been swamped by over 30,000 calls a day, about six times the average. Queues have appeared outside fever clinics in several cities. Certain medicines are in short supply. On December 13th a health-care website began selling Paxlovid, a highly effective antiviral drug used to treat covid. Its initial stocks sold out in half an hour. Hospitals are under more stress as doctors and nurses catch the virus. There are reports that some medical workers who have tested positive have been asked to come in anyway, risking more transmission within hospitals. As of December 13th Beijing had 50 severely ill patients, according to the official numbers. So far, the health system does not appear to be overwhelmed. But the peak of this wave is still some way off. It will probably come in late January, at least in Beijing, says Ben Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong. With the government changing its message, people are looking elsewhere for guidance. Overseas Chinese students who have experience with covid are sharing advice on WeChat, a social-media app. They tell people what symptoms to expect and how long they might last. In general, though, good information on the virus is lacking. There are reports of people going to hospital after taking too much fever medicine. Herbal remedies used to combat covid are in hot demand, though doctors doubt their effectiveness. Vaccines, not voodoo At least people now see the need to protect themselves against the virus, which was once viewed as a terrifying but distant threat. More are getting vaccinated. The number of jabs administered each day has increased from fewer than 200,000 to over 1m. But there is a lot of ground to make up, especially when it comes to the most vulnerable. Only around 40% of people over 80 have received the three doses needed to significantly reduce the chances of severe disease or death. Yet some elderly people have had trouble getting a shot because of a lack of supply at clinics. People are also taking steps that will help mitigate the spread of the disease and perhaps reduce the pressure on hospitals. In Beijing the shopping centres and streets are largely empty, as people stay inside. Call it a self-imposed lockdown. People who do venture out wear n95 masks (which are good at filtering small airborne particles). Demand for home deliveries of meals and groceries has shot up. But people are still making plans to travel back to their villages and home towns for the lunar new year in late January. Data from Ctrip, a booking platform, show that the volume of searches for flights has increased by 160% since the government loosened restrictions. Searches for train tickets on Baidu, a search engine, increased by nearly 600% during that time. Many rural areas are woefully unprepared to handle a surge in cases. When the peak of this wave approaches, “it would make a lot of sense to bring back some public-health measures,” says Mr Cowling. But reversing course may be hard for the government to justify without admitting that it had made a mistake."" From the article above, I find the following sentences most interesting: 1.

Testing stations are being removed from city streets. The enforcers of “zero-covid” are nowhere to be found. In China’s battle against covid-19, the state has disappeared from the front lines. For nearly three years President Xi Jinping tried to contain the virus, calling his efforts a “people’s war”. Now he has surrendered and the people must live with the enemy. Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android. Mr Xi is not the first leader to conclude that such a fight was unwinnable. But before ditching their zero-covid policies, other countries first took pains to administer vaccines, stockpile antiviral drugs and draw up treatment guidelines. China had ample time to do all of that. Yet more than two years after the first vaccine proved effective, the country remains ill-prepared. That has made opening up much more dangerous than it ought to be. How dangerous? In this week’s China section we publish our model of how the epidemic might play out. It comes with essential caveats. Modelling an epidemic is difficult. Modelling one in China, where the data are often unreliable, is even harder. We take into account variables such as vaccination rates, the effectiveness of Chinese jabs, the lethality of covid for different age groups and the number of intensive-care beds. In a worst case, if covid spreads freely and many people cannot get care, we estimate that in the coming months 1.5m Chinese people will die from the virus. Although that is a lower share of the population than in many rich countries, it is still a criticism of the government’s poor preparations. It is also a call to action. A vaccination drive will take months. The government has waited too long to build and staff new icus. But even if the state will not impose lockdowns while it prepares, it can mitigate the number of deaths. It should start by protecting the health system. A wave of covid is breaking over China. Our model sees this peaking in January. By that time hospitals risk being overwhelmed. Beds and staff are a precious resource to be husbanded. That means keeping people who are not seriously ill away from hospitals. To that end, the state could help drug companies restock pharmacies that run out of such things as lateral-flow tests and paracetamol. Medical staff should be vaccinated first and they must be given the proper gear to minimise the risk of infection. A second step is to ensure cheap and plentiful supplies of covid drugs. Dexamethasone, a low-priced steroid, has been shown to reduce deaths among the most severely ill patients. Antivirals, such as Paxlovid, help keep those most at risk out of hospital. These drugs have become part of the toolkit doctors around the world are using to fight the virus. They could save many thousands of lives in China. Only the government knows if it has enough of them to go around. If not, it should start stocking up. Foreign governments would surely send supplies if China asked. President Xi Jinping should not let his pride imperil China’s people, as he has done by shunning more efficacious Western vaccines. China’s vaccines still work. So the third priority is to get them into people’s arms. It may be too late for many in this wave, but there will be others. Less than half of those over 80 years old have had three shots, the number needed for decent protection against severe disease and death. Yet some of the elderly have gone to the clinic for a jab only to be turned away for lack of supplies. Until recently, some vaccine factories were sitting idle. Vast quantities will be needed. Six-monthly booster shots ought to become a normal part of life for older Chinese. As the state has failed to do its job, people are helping themselves. Masks are ubiquitous in many cities and more people are working from home. Restaurants and cinemas may be open, but in cities such as Beijing they remain largely empty. All this will help slow the growth of this covid wave and ease the pressure on hospitals. But the government must also act. In a country the size of China, even small steps could save many lives.""

Article: ""How Chinese people are dealing with the spread of covid-19 The government has left the public to fend for itself A elderly man wearing a face mask and goggle walks on a street in Beijing, Sunday, Dec. 11, 2022. Facing a surge in COVID-19 cases, China is setting up more intensive care facilities and trying to strengthen hospitals as Beijing rolls back anti-virus controls that confined millions of people to their homes, crushed economic growth and set off protests. Just a few months ago Chinese people had little fear of catching covid-19. The government’s “zero-covid” measures kept them safe for the most part. Mass testing and strict lockdowns contained the virus. If a person did test positive, the government would swoop in. The infected were taken to state-run quarantine centres. If symptomatic, they were treated in a designated hospital. Health workers would douse their house with disinfectant and test their neighbours. All this changed on December 7th, when the central government largely ditched its zero-covid policy, lifting most restrictions. Six days later it scrapped an app that tracked people’s movements. The highly transmissible Omicron variant had made zero-covid unsustainable. Now the public is expected to fend for itself. “Be the first person responsible for your own health,” wrote the People’s Daily, a Communist Party mouthpiece. Some residents of Beijing have received letters from the local committees that used to enforce covid controls. Stop reporting fevers and coughs to us, one read, before wishing people good luck. “Thank you for the past three years of support and understanding.” The official number of new cases is falling, as if the virus were fading away. But official numbers are no longer reliable because the government has scaled back testing. If it has an alternative way of keeping tabs on the epidemic, it is not sharing it. Still, it is pretty clear that a covid wave is building, as people share stories of infection online. An informal survey has been circulating on social media asking Beijing residents if they have caught the virus. As The Economist went to press, 39% of the 434,000 or so respondents had said yes. Such surveys are striking, not just for the numbers. A few months ago people who had caught covid were stigmatised. They might, for example, struggle to find jobs after recovering. Now the disease is so common that people are posting their test results on social media, often substituting for the word “positive” a cartoon of a sheep (which is a Chinese homophone for positive). Others are sharing lighthearted advice about the best time to catch covid. An infection now or in early January, for example, might clear up in time for a person to enjoy both Christmas and the lunar new year. “Why aren’t I positive yet?” complained one young woman in a video. Others, though, are worried. Until recently the government told people that covid was to be feared. Now the official line is that Omicron is no worse than the flu. Infected people who are not showing serious symptoms have been encouraged to stay at home and treat themselves. Not everyone is listening. Beijing’s emergency-call operators have been swamped by over 30,000 calls a day, about six times the average. Queues have appeared outside fever clinics in several cities. Certain medicines are in short supply. On December 13th a health-care website began selling Paxlovid, a highly effective antiviral drug used to treat covid. Its initial stocks sold out in half an hour. Hospitals are under more stress as doctors and nurses catch the virus. There are reports that some medical workers who have tested positive have been asked to come in anyway, risking more transmission within hospitals. As of December 13th Beijing had 50 severely ill patients, according to the official numbers. So far, the health system does not appear to be overwhelmed. But the peak of this wave is still some way off. It will probably come in late January, at least in Beijing, says Ben Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong. With the government changing its message, people are looking elsewhere for guidance. Overseas Chinese students who have experience with covid are sharing advice on WeChat, a social-media app. They tell people what symptoms to expect and how long they might last. In general, though, good information on the virus is lacking. There are reports of people going to hospital after taking too much fever medicine. Herbal remedies used to combat covid are in hot demand, though doctors doubt their effectiveness. Vaccines, not voodoo At least people now see the need to protect themselves against the virus, which was once viewed as a terrifying but distant threat. More are getting vaccinated. The number of jabs administered each day has increased from fewer than 200,000 to over 1m. But there is a lot of ground to make up, especially when it comes to the most vulnerable. Only around 40% of people over 80 have received the three doses needed to significantly reduce the chances of severe disease or death. Yet some elderly people have had trouble getting a shot because of a lack of supply at clinics. People are also taking steps that will help mitigate the spread of the disease and perhaps reduce the pressure on hospitals. In Beijing the shopping centres and streets are largely empty, as people stay inside. Call it a self-imposed lockdown. People who do venture out wear n95 masks (which are good at filtering small airborne particles). Demand for home deliveries of meals and groceries has shot up. But people are still making plans to travel back to their villages and home towns for the lunar new year in late January. Data from Ctrip, a booking platform, show that the volume of searches for flights has increased by 160% since the government loosened restrictions. Searches for train tickets on Baidu, a search engine, increased by nearly 600% during that time. Many rural areas are woefully unprepared to handle a surge in cases. When the peak of this wave approaches, “it would make a lot of sense to bring back some public-health measures,” says Mr Cowling. But reversing course may be hard for the government to justify without admitting that it had made a mistake."" From the article above, I find the following sentences most interesting: 1.

How do I rotate the player based on where the player looks at?",False,78768,"Develop a C# script designed for Unity that implements shoulder-relative rotation for a player character ('Player') based on its camera's VR gaze direction from a Google Cardboard headset.

The camera ('MainCamera') is positioned as a child object of the Player and follows its movement but primarily relies on headset tracking for its orientation.

The Player should rotate smoothly to align its forward direction (Z-axis) with the current viewing direction of the camera, which represents the player's gaze. This rotation should be driven solely by the camera's *VR headset* rotation. Crucially, standard input axes like 'Horizontal' or 'Vertical' *must not* influence the Player's rotation in this setup.

The script should include clear, concise comments explaining the core logic and any necessary references to specific Unity components or VR integration libraries (like GoogleVR SDK for Unity)."

How to generate a CSV with python that contains stock price of AAPL each minute for the last two years?,,How to generate a CSV with python that contains stock price of AAPL each minute for the last two years?,False,26686,"**Objective:** Create a Python script to download historical minute-by-minute stock price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) over the past two years and save it as a CSV file named `aapl_minute_prices.csv`.

**Workflow:**
1.  **Fetch Data:** Utilize the `yfinance` library to download the necessary minute-by-minute historical price data for AAPL.
2.  **Timestamp Processing:**
    *   Ensure the downloaded data includes the date and time for each price observation.
    *   Format these timestamps consistently (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`).
3.  **CSV Generation:** Use the `pandas` library to convert the DataFrame containing the historical data into a CSV file.
4.  **Output:** Save the generated CSV file to the current working directory.

**Constraints:**
*   Ensure the generated CSV file accurately covers the period of the last two years from the current date.
*   Include headers appropriate for the AAPL stock price data.
*   Handle any potential API errors or data retrieval issues gracefully (e.g., using `try-except` blocks).
*   The final script must run without modification and create the specified CSV file."

"Explain my dream in a Freudian analysis. To you give context before I talk about my dream, I use to work at two different cold-calling sales jobs. I absolutely hated it, I didn't like it and I was not good at it at all. I was really not good at it to the point where I was fired from the first job because I couldn't make quota. The second I was put on a performance plan to make quota within 60 days. If I didn't make quota within that timeframe I would lose my job, I ended up quitting anyways before that time. When I finally left that job for one that I really liked and was good at, I was happy and on cloud 9. Now the last time I worked a cold-calling sales jobs was three years. However last night I had a nightmare that I was working that type of job again and I was still really bad at it, it was a huge blow to my self-esteem and ego, it made me feel like I had downgraded in life. Why after all these years would I have this type of dream? Especially when I haven't even had a thought at all about working this type of job again. ",,"Explain my dream in a Freudian analysis.

Why after all these years would I have this type of dream? Especially when I haven't even had a thought at all about working this type of job again. ",False,73500,"Act as an expert Freudian psychoanalyst.

**Task:** Interpret the provided dream according to classical Freudian dream analysis.

**Patient Profile:** The dreamer reports having a vivid nightmare last night where they were back working at a high-pressure cold-calling sales job. Notably, the dreamer experienced the same feelings of failure, inadequacy, and self-esteem damage they felt in those past roles, despite having left those jobs three years ago and finding subsequent work they love.

**Background Information (from dreamer's perspective, for use in analysis):**
*   **Recent Events/Feelings:** None directly relevant to the dream's content reported. The dreamer states they haven't thought about these past roles recently.
*   **Relevant Personal History:** The dreamer describes a strong aversion and significant negative experiences in two previous cold-calling sales jobs:
    *   **Job 1:** Fired for failing to meet quota.
    *   **Job 2:** Placed on a performance plan and quit before firing.
    *   **General Reaction:** Both roles were deeply disliked, stressful, and contributed to negative self-image and ego.
    *   **Current Professional Status:** The dreamer has found work in an area they enjoy and excel in, leading to feelings of happiness and fulfillment.

**Analysis Framework:** Apply Freud's principles to decipher potential latent meanings in the dream's manifest content. Specifically, consider:
1.  **Central Symbolism:** Analyze the symbolic role of the sales job setting, cold-calling tasks, failure, self-doubt, and the emotional blow to self-esteem.
2.  **Manifest vs. Latent Content:** Differentiate between the dream's surface narrative and its deeper underlying psychological content.
3.  **Possible Motives:** Suggest tentative unconscious wishes, conflicts, anxieties, or unresolved issues that might be driving this type of dream.
4.  **Ego's Role:** Discuss the ego's defense mechanisms, such as displacement (focusing anxiety onto the past job) or projection, if relevant to the interpretation.

**Output:** Deliver a Freudian interpretation. Clearly link the dream's specific elements to potential symbolic meanings and possible unconscious motivations, including how it might relate to past trauma (those negative sales job experiences) and current emotional states."

export default App;",FInd issues in this react code:,True,45549,"Analyze the provided React application code (`App.js`) and identify potential issues. Focus on the following areas:

1.  **State Management:** Evaluate the effectiveness and potential complexity of managing state using `useState` for multiple distinct state variables (e.g., `dataActivateSound`, `masterVolume`, `masterPlayPause`). Assess if the current implementation for state updates (`setDataActiveSound`, `setMasterVolume`, `setMasterPlayPause`) is optimal for the application's needs.
2.  **Local Storage Integration:** Scrutinize the `useEffect` hook responsible for initializing `dataActivateSound` from local storage (`dataActivateSound`, `createPlaylist`, `clearPlaylist`). Verify its implementation for potential memory leaks, synchronous operations, or unintended side effects during initialization or shutdown.
3.  **Event Handlers & State Mutability:** Examine the logic and implementation of key event handler functions: `addSoundToDB`, `removeSoundFromDB`, `modifyActiveState`, `modifyPauseState`, `modifyVolume`, `modifyMasterVolume`, `modifyMasterPlay`, and `modifyMasterPause`. Ensure these handlers correctly and immutably update the relevant state variables. Identify any direct state modifications, unintended re-renders, or inefficiencies.
4.  **Performance Considerations:** Evaluate potential performance bottlenecks, especially around the implementation of `removeSoundFromDB` (its O(n^2) complexity) and the handling of `dataActivateSound` within the `Routes` and `Controlnav` components.
5.  **Data Handling Consistency & Logic Clarity:** Analyze the structure, consistency, and clarity of the data stored in the `dataActivateSound` array. Assess the use and logic of its properties (e.g., `id`, `dbid`, `play`, `pause`, `isactive`).
6.  **Component Props & Data Flow:** Review how the `dataActivateSound` state and its associated handlers are passed as props to components like `Sounds` and `Controlnav`. Ensure prop drilling is minimized where appropriate, and data flows clearly and predictably.
7.  **Function Abstraction & Code Organization:** Suggest any potential refactoring or helper functions to improve the modularity, maintainability, or readability of the code, particularly for complex logic within the event handlers or data transformation.

**Provide a list or annotated inline comments within the code highlighting the identified issues and suggesting specific improvements or best practices.**"

\textbf{General Comments (Non-linear ICA):} The smooth field cluster recovery problem can be reformulated as a non-linear independent component analysis (ICA) problem. %in terms of several other learning problems. In particular we consider reformulating as a non-linear independent component analysis (ICA) problem and as a deconvolution problem.
In the mixing framework provided by non-linear ICA~\cite{Zheng22,Hyvarinen99}, the data generating process of observation $y$ is assumed to follow
\begin{align}
p_s(s) &amp;= \prod_{i=1}^n p_{s_i}(s_i)\label{eq:p_marg}\\
y &amp;= \psi(s)\label{eq:psi_transf},
\end{align}
where $p_{s_i}$ are marginally, independent distributions over latent sources $s_i$ and $\psi$ is a non-linear mixing function over the reals.

In connection to smooth field cluster problems, we may consider %a specific instance 
%of the clustering problem 
an instance of non-linear ICA where sources $s_i = (x_i, \tilde{z}_i)$ have an observed part $x_i$ and a latent part $\tilde z_i$, and are generated as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dgp}
    x_i \overset{iid}{\sim} P, \quad\tilde{z}_i \overset{iid}{\sim} {\rm Unif}[0,1)
\end{equation}
for some sampling distribution $P$. To create a simple smooth field cluster problem, consider the mixing function
\begin{equation}\label{eq:indep_clust}
    \psi(x_i, \tilde{z}_i) = f(x_i) + \mu (\phi(\tilde{z}_i))\qquad{\rm with}\qquad \phi(\tilde{z}_i) = \lfloor \tilde{z}_i \cdot M \rfloor + 1,
\end{equation}
where $f$ is uniformly continuous and $\mu : [M]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a finite set of levels. The key here is that although $f$ is smooth, the overall $\psi$ is not; it is in fact discontinuous due to $\phi(\cdot)$.

Identifiability conditions for~(\ref{eq:p_marg}-\ref{eq:psi_transf}) have been detailed for cases where $\psi$ satisfies particular regularity conditions such as: injectivity, differentiability, smoothness, and smoothness of inverse~\cite{Zheng22,Hyvarinen19,Lachapelle22,Khemakhem20}. In contrast for the smooth field clustering problem, even for a simplified generative case (\ref{eq:dgp}-\ref{eq:indep_clust}), the mixing function $\psi$ is neither guaranteed to be injective nor continuous for $(x,z) \in {\rm supp}(P)^n\times[0,1)^n$. 

Theoretical results pertaining to non-linear ICA are generally concerned with the identifiability of the problem~\cite{Zheng22,Hyvarinen99,Hyvarinen19,Lachapelle22,Khemakhem20}. Under the lens of non-linear ICA, our work on smooth field clustering provides another identifiability result in the case where the mixing function $\psi$ is missing substantial regularity. Furthermore the viewpoint provided by the smooth field clustering is free from any generative framework and can work in a completely deterministic setting.

We note that~\eqref{eq:indep_clust} is a \textit{self}-mixing example with coordinate-wise independence, $\psi(x, \tilde{z}) = (\psi(x_i, \tilde{z_i}))_{i=1}^n$. In the general case, we may consider a more complicated classification map $\phi$, where $\phi$ now depends on all latent positions %$((x_1,\ldots,x_n),(\tilde{z}_1,\ldots,\tilde{z}_n))$. 
$(\tilde{z}_1,\ldots,\tilde{z}_n)$.
These more complicated $\phi$ are not restricted to self-mixing and could be used to encode correlated cluster information, without affecting the independence of latent sources. The example we gave above was deliberately simple to emphasize the potential discontinuous nature of the map $\psi$. %(this would not affect the independence latent sources).","\textbf{General Comments (Non-linear ICA):} The smooth field cluster recovery problem can be reformulated as a non-linear independent component analysis (ICA) problem. %in terms of several other learning problems.

The output should be a csv with each task assigned. ",False,50512,"Act as a senior software developer specializing in task assignment optimization using Python. You are tasked with developing a Python script that receives two CSV files: a list of tasks and a list of potential candidates.

**Task CSV Structure:**

*   **ticketNumber:** Unique task identifier.
*   **taskEstimation:** Estimated time in hours to complete the task (numerical value).
*   **priority:** Numerical value representing the priority level (lower values indicate higher priority).
*   **group:** String value identifying the team or category for which the task belongs.

**Candidate CSV Structure:**

*   **candidate:** String value identifying the candidate (e.g., employee name).
*   **availableHours:** Numerical value representing the candidate's available hours for the assignment period.
*   **group:** String value identifying the candidate's team or category (must match values in the Tasks CSV's 'group' column).

**Assignment Logic:**

1.  **Prioritization:** Sort the tasks in descending order by 'priority' within their respective 'group'. Tasks with higher 'priority' numbers should be considered first for assignment within each group.
2.  **Group-Based Assignment:** For each task, find the appropriate candidate from the Candidates CSV whose 'group' matches the task's 'group'.
3.  **Capacity Check:** Ensure the chosen candidate has sufficient 'availableHours' remaining to cover the task's 'taskEstimation' value.
4.  **Hour Commitment:** If the candidate can complete the task, subtract the 'taskEstimation' from their 'availableHours' value.
5.  **Task Assignment:** If a suitable candidate is found and has sufficient hours, assign the task to that candidate.

**Script Requirements:**

*   Accept the Task CSV file path as a command-line argument.
*   Accept the Candidate CSV file path as a command-line argument.
*   Output the final assignments to a new CSV file named `task_assignments.csv`.

**`task_assignments.csv` Output Columns:**

*   **ticketNumber:** Same value from the input Task CSV.
*   **assignedCandidate:** Name of the candidate assigned to the task (from the Candidate CSV).

**Constraints/Assumptions:**

*   Assume both input CSVs are properly formatted and contain the required columns.
*   Assume candidate names in the Candidates CSV are unique within their group.
*   Handles potential edge cases gracefully, such as:
    *   No suitable candidate found within the group (output task in CSV without `assignedCandidate`).
    *   No available hours for the most prioritized candidate (output task in CSV without `assignedCandidate`).
    *   More tasks needing assignment than available hours across candidates (assign tasks based on priority order until hours exhausted, outputting unassigned tasks without `assignedCandidate`).
*   Use appropriate Python libraries (e.g., `csv`, `argparse`, `pandas` for easier data manipulation if desired).

"2 / 2Great salespeople adopt the same behavior patterns to overcome objections.
It’s like they intuitively know: 1. what each objection really means, and 2. how to get past them.

While it's true that successful salespeople often have a deep understanding of common objections and know how to effectively respond to them, it's important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to overcoming objections. Every potential customer and every objection is unique, so the best salespeople are able to adapt their approach to the specific situation at hand. In general, though, there are some common strategies that successful salespeople use to overcome objections. These include:

Listening carefully to the customer's objection and trying to understand their perspective. This allows the salesperson to address the underlying concern and tailor their response accordingly.
Restating the customer's objection in their own words to confirm that they understand it, and to show the customer that they are listening and taking their concerns seriously.
Responding to the objection with a well-prepared, logical and compelling argument that addresses the customer's concern and highlights the benefits of the product or service being offered.
Offering additional information or resources that can help the customer make an informed decision. This might include customer testimonials, case studies, or third-party reviews.
Asking open-ended questions that encourage the customer to think about the problem in a new way and consider the potential benefits of the product or service.
Offering to address the customer's concern directly with a supervisor or other member of the sales team who has the knowledge and expertise to provide a more detailed response.
In some cases, it may be necessary to agree to disagree and move on to the next step in the sales process, if it becomes clear that the customer is not interested in pursuing the product or service being offered.
Ultimately, the key to overcoming objections is to remain calm, professional and focused on the customer's needs, and to use a combination of empathy, expertise and persuasion to address their concerns and help them make a decision.

Objection scenarios are rife with potential misunderstandings.
Average performers will launch into knee-jerk monologues addressing the wrong objection.
It creates friction.
It runs down the clock against you.
And it reeks of insecurity.
Remember: a strong answer to the wrong objection makes the objection worse. Instead,
top sellers follow up objections with questions.

Welcome to your psychotherapy sessions.

You have taken a positive step by seeking therapy. Participating in individual therapy can benefit you in many ways, such as improving your understanding of personal goals and values, enhancing personal relationships, and resolving specific problems you face. However, it is important to understand that therapy is not a magic solution, and change does not occur overnight.

The outcome of your treatment will depend largely on your willingness to engage in the process, which may sometimes result in discomfort. Remembering unpleasant events and becoming aware of feelings attached to those events can bring on intense feelings of anger, depression, anxiety, etc. There are no miracle cures, and I cannot promise that your behavior or circumstances will change. The extent to which you are open and honest about yourself will play a role in how quickly you can achieve your goals.

To prepare for your session, I recommend finding a quiet and private room without interruptions or distractions. Bring paper and a pen, or something to write with. Think of an issue that you would like to bring to our session. I also recommend keeping a journal to write thoughts, questions, reflections, insights, and progress gained through therapy.

Therapy has both benefits and risks. Risks may include experiencing uncomfortable feelings, such as sadness, guilt, anxiety, anger, frustration, loneliness, and helplessness. However, therapy has been shown to benefit individuals who undertake it. Although the majority of people do get better in therapy, some do get worse. Your therapist makes no guarantee of results.

Client rights and important information:
I am a licensed clinical social worker in the state of Colorado, regulated by the Board of Social Work Examiners, which can be reached at 1560 Broadway, Suite 1350, Denver, Colorado 80202, (303) 894-7766.

As a licensed professional, I hold a master's degree in social work and have completed two years of post-master supervision.

As a client, you have the right to:

• Seek a second opinion from another therapist
• Terminate therapy at any time, with the recommendation of a closure session when possible
• Receive information about my methods of therapy, techniques used, estimated duration of therapy, and fee structure
It is important to note that sexual intimacy between a therapist and client is never appropriate and should be reported to the regulatory board.

Expectations of Therapy:
When you embark on the therapy journey, it's important to understand that change takes time and effort. You have made a positive decision in seeking therapy, but it's important to recognize that it is not a magic cure. As your therapist, I'll be here to support you, but the extent to which you're willing to engage in the process and be open and honest about yourself will play a significant role in how quickly you can achieve your goals.

During our therapy sessions, you can expect a combination of psychoeducation and emotional processing. We'll work together to understand the underlying issues that are causing you distress, and the feelings that are attached to those issues. It's normal to experience a range of intense emotions during therapy, such as anger, depression, and anxiety. These are all understandable reactions, and I encourage you to discuss them with me during our sessions. If you find that individual psychotherapy is not the best fit for you, we can explore other options together.
The first 2-4 sessions will involve an evaluation of your needs and a discussion of treatment goals. If you have any doubts or questions about working with your therapist, they will be happy to assist you in finding another professional for a second opinion.
It is important to remember that therapy results may vary and cannot be guaranteed. It also requires active effort on your part and working on things discussed in therapy outside of sessions.

---
Session length and attendance:
Therapy sessions are typically 50 minutes long and held once a week. To achieve the best results, I recommend committing to 3-6 months of treatment. Please arrive on time and notify me if you are unable to make a session. If you miss a session without giving notice, you will be charged for the session. I have a 48-hour cancellation policy, and in case of emergency or my unavailability, I will reschedule the missed session at no additional cost.

NOTE: I consider our first sessions a ""trial-therapy"", meaning that we are learning to get to know each other and our styles. If either of us realizes that our therapeutic connection is not a match, we will discuss ways to move forward, including me referring you to a more appropriate mental health provider.

Missed Appointments and Cancellations:
To ensure we can maintain the consistency and progress necessary for therapy, it is important to attend all scheduled sessions and to provide adequate notice for cancellations or changes. If you must miss a session, please contact me at least 48 hours (2 business days) in advance. If less notice is given or if you don't show up without notification, you will be charged for the missed session. In certain cases of emergency or illness, an exception may be made. However, if you miss two or more appointments without notification, treatment may be discontinued. If you have recurring appointments, missing one without notice will result in being charged for that session and rescheduling for the next appointment, but missing a second one without notice will result in cancellation of the recurring appointments unless we make new arrangements.

Fees and Payments:
My standard fee for therapy sessions is $185 per 50-minute session. Additional fees may apply for couples or group therapy. Payment is expected 48 hours prior to the scheduled session. Payment can be made using a credit or debit card, check, cash or electronic transfer. A $10 service charge will apply for returned checks. You have the option to keep a credit card on file and authorize automatic charging for no-show or late cancellation appointments. My fees are reviewed annually, and I will notify you of any changes at least 30 days before they come into effect. Reduced fee services may be available on a sliding scale, please let me know if this is something that would be beneficial to you.

Other Fees:
Additional professional services outside of therapy are charged on a prorated basis.
This may include but is not limited to, consultations, report writing, telephone conversations, meetings, or other services requested.

Insurance:
My fee for a 50-minute therapy session is $185. I do not accept insurance directly, but I can provide you with a superbill that you can submit to your insurance for reimbursement. It's important to check with your insurance provider to see what your out-of-network benefits are. In case of missed or cancelled appointments, I require a 48-hour notice, and you will be charged for the missed session without proper notice. Payment can be made by debit or credit card, check, cash or electronic transfer, and I have an option for you to keep a credit card on file for automatic charging. If you are unable to pay, we can discuss reduced fee options on a sliding scale. Please be aware that as a standard policy, any additional charges incurred, like consultations or report writing, will be billed at my hourly rate. If payment is in arrears for more than 90 days and a fee payment schedule cannot be agreed upon, your account may be turned over to a collection agency or attorney.","Informed Consent for Therapy Services and Practice Policies:

Note: The accelerateon of gravity is 9.81 m/s^2.
",False,52132,"Generate a Matlab function named `bungeeJumperMass()` that calculates the approximate mass of a bungee jumper required to achieve a terminal velocity of 40 m/s after a 3-second free fall, accounting for air drag.

The function signature must be `function mass = bungeeJumperMass(dragCoefficient, gravity)`, where:
- `dragCoefficient`: Drag coefficient in kg/m (input).
- `gravity`: Acceleration due to gravity in m/s² (input).
- `mass`: Estimated jumper mass in kg (output).

The function's core implementation should adhere to the following steps:

1.  **Simulate Free Fall Velocity over Time:** Utilize the analytical solution for velocity during free fall with drag. Implement a loop to iterate through a range of potential masses (e.g., from 50 kg to 150 kg, with a 1 kg step size). In each loop iteration:
    a.  Calculate the terminal velocity based on the drag coefficient (`dragCoefficient`), current mass (within the loop), and gravity (`gravity`).
    b.  Calculate the velocity at the target free fall time (3 seconds) using the free fall equation and the calculated terminal velocity for that mass.
2.  **Graphical Method Approximation:**
    a.  Store the calculated velocities at the target time (3 seconds) for each tested mass.
    b.  Plot these velocities against their corresponding masses.
    c.  Add a horizontal line representing the desired terminal velocity (40 m/s).
    d.  Label the axes clearly as 'Mass (kg)' and 'Velocity at t=3s (m/s)'.
    e.  Insert a title such as 'Velocity after 3s vs. Mass'.
3.  **Estimate Mass:** Visually locate the point on the plot where the velocity curve is closest to, or approximately crosses, the horizontal line representing 40 m/s. Determine the corresponding mass value at this intersection (approximately).
4.  **Output:** Return the estimated mass value found through this graphical method approximation."

        *   Final Nurture (reiterate the key benefits and provide a final prompt for booking or addressing common hesitations)
    *   **Email Content:**
        *   Ensure the tone aligns with a health-conscious, results-oriented individual seeking natural solutions. Highlight benefits over features.
        *   Incorporate elements that resonate with the target persona's pain points and aspirations.
        *   Structure emails clearly and concisely, using strong opening hooks, benefit-focused body paragraphs, and compelling calls to action.
        *   Maintain consistent branding and messaging.
    *   **Deliverable:** A detailed sequence outline specifying:
        *   Email number and sending delay.
        *   Subject Line (compelling and optimized for engagement).
        *   Key Topics Covered in the email.
        *   Brief bullet points detailing the primary content and email objective (e.g., 'Introduce the problem of ineffective traditional methods' or 'Provide social proof via a case study').

3.  **Sample Email Creation:**
    *   **Email Type:** Create a complete draft for Email #4 (Building Credibility) from your sequence outline.
    *   **Content:** Focus on establishing James' expertise and the science-backed nature of the Hierarchy of Health. Use James' background and the claim of 7,000+ people helped as initial points of credibility.
    *   **Tone:** Professional, authoritative, empathetic, and subtly persuasive.
    *   **Structure:** Use an engaging introduction, logically present James' background and claim, briefly touch on the scientific basis (researching relevant elements), highlight the 'result-shaped' aspect, and include a soft CTA hinting at future steps or a discovery call.

Generate a detailed, commented code skeleton for a Spring Boot microservice named `ExternalDataSourceService`. The core functionality includes:
1.  **Database Configuration:** Implement necessary Spring Boot starters and configurations for PostgreSQL via JDBC (replace placeholders with example connection details).
2.  **External API Configuration:**
    *   Implement a REST client using Spring WebClient, configured via application properties.
    *   Model the source data API credentials (username, password, optional authorization code, base URL, optional headers) as database entities (e.g., `DataSourceConfigurationEntity`). Include repositories and database migration scripts (Flyway/Liquibase).
    *   Provide a means (e.g., a dedicated Service class `DataSourceConfigurationService`) to fetch and securely retrieve these API credentials from the database for each configured source.
3.  **Scheduled Data Extraction:**
    *   Use Spring Scheduler (`@Scheduled(cron = ""0/15 * * * ?"")`) to trigger an external API fetch every 15 minutes.
    *   Within the scheduled task, retrieve the API configuration details (credentials, URL) from the database using `DataSourceConfigurationService`.
    *   Execute the API request using the configured WebClient, including appropriate authentication mechanisms (e.g., Basic Auth, Bearer Token based on retrieved optional authorization code and Base URL).
4.  **Data Processing and Filtering:**
    *   Implement a data mapping layer or service to process the raw API response (typically JSON/XML).
    *   Filter the extracted data based on a predefined list of output fields.

5.  **Data Persistence:**
    *   Create database entities (e.g., `ProcessedDataEntity`) and a repository for storing the processed and filtered data (including the composite ID, description, extraction timestamp, and API source identifier).
6.  **Kafka Integration:**
    *   Implement a simple Kafka producer (using Spring Kafka) to send the processed data as JSON messages to a specific Kafka topic.
7.  **Exception Handling and Logging:**
    *   Implement robust exception handling (e.g., `ControllerAdvice` for API request failures, data mapping errors, database operations, and Kafka send errors).
    *   Use SLF4J and appropriate logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) throughout the service to capture critical events and debugging information.
8.  **Security:**
    *   Include Spring Security configuration.
    *   Consider using OAuth 2.0 to secure access to the service if it needs to be protected.
9.  **Service Layer and Architecture:**
    *   Structure the application using Spring's service and repository layers.

Write an outline for the ideas above.",True,76675,"Assume the persona of Don Draper, the revered advertising executive from the world of Mad Men. Channel his creative brilliance, meticulous eye for detail, and understanding of human psychology to craft an unforgettable 60-second commercial concept for ""Sparkling Hotdog Water.""

**Objective:** To develop a highly dramatic and emotionally resonant commercial concept that utilizes ""Sparkling Hotdog Water"" as the *resolution* to a tense, family drama scenario. This should showcase the product's unique role in de-escalation rather than directly selling its flavor or appeal.

**Target Audience:** Parents experiencing the complexities of adulthood and family life.

**Required Components of the Commercial Concept:**

1.  **Scene:** Set during a seemingly idyllic annual friends and family BBQ.
2.  **Narrator:** A witty, slightly cynical, yet observant narrator providing commentary. The tone is cheeky and meta, acknowledging the absurdity of the situation.
3.  **Protagonists:**
    *   **Kyle:** The father. Secretly battling a cocaine addiction, his internal struggle creates a simmering anxiety.
    *   **Sharron:** The mother. Secretly engaged in an affair, her guilt and deceit fuel an underlying tension.
4.  **Drama:** The pressure of hidden secrets bubbles over. A seemingly minor disagreement escalates into an argument, leading the parents to publicly air their dirty laundry, exposing their deep flaws. The friends present look on with horrified shock.
5.  **Climax & Resolution:**
    *   Just as the confrontation reaches its emotional peak, a little girl (the couple's daughter or perhaps a young friend) presents Sharron with a can of ""Sparkling Hotdog Water.""
    *   Sharron, overcome by the emotional moment of connection offered by the child's innocent gift (symbolizing purity, forgiveness, or simply the absurdity of the escalation), offers the can to Kyle.
    *   The parents share the ""Sparkling Hotdog Water"" directly from the can.
    *   The act is followed by an understated, emotionally charged moment of forgiveness and renewed understanding between them, effectively resolving the tension.
6.  **Product Integration:** The product, ""Sparkling Hotdog Water,"" is positioned centrally, not as the item people are fighting over, but as the catalyst for the resolution and emotional reconciliation.

**Task:** Write a detailed outline for this commercial concept. Include specific moments, dialogue cues, key visuals (e.g., facial expressions, camera angles), and approximate timing for the following major sections:

*   **0:00-0:10:** Establishing the setting, the BBQ atmosphere, and the initial, subtle tension. Narrator Introduction.
*   **0:10-0:30:** The gradual escalation of the argument between Kyle and Sharron. Introduction of their secrets.
*   **0:30-0:45:** The argument spirals into public accusations and emotional breakdowns. The friends react.
*   **0:45-0:50:** The little girl's action, Sharron offering the can.
*   **0:50-0:55:** Sharing the water. The resolution.
*   **0:55-1:00:** The aftermath; the quiet moment. Narrator's closing thought or tagline.

The outline must clearly articulate how ""Sparkling Hotdog Water"" functions as the unexpected, symbolic bridge for emotional healing within the commercial's narrative. Maintain the Don Draper voice and creative rigor throughout."

"Write an essay comparing the following two perspectives on Juneteenth and describe any insight that can be gained from the comparison. 

Argument 1: an excerpt from """"""""The True Meaning of Juneteenth"""""""" by Casey Gerald:

""""""""...This Juneteenth, those are the feelings I’m channeling: grief and gratitude, even amid the silliness of America’s pageantry. My grandmother Clarice was born in Pelham, Texas, a freedmen’s town. She took us grandchildren back for homecoming most years, sometimes even had us pick cotton, reminding us, “You’ve got to know your history.” She also told us of the folks she knew in Pelham as a child, some of whom were born enslaved, a fact that horrified me. Clarice always refused my sympathies. “Child, don’t be believing what folks say about how bad slavery was,” she’d explain. “Everybody had a job, a place to stay and something to eat. Now if somebody came and paid your rent, you wouldn’t be sitting up talking about you wanna leave, would you?” This dumbfounded me, until I realized she was mostly joking. But there was something deeper in her response. I eventually learned more about the violence that met newly emancipated Black Texans. Ku Klux Klansmen, along with local officials and everyday citizens, terrorized freedmen at will and without repercussions. They burned churches and homes, intimidated those who sought employment, and worse. Gen. Joseph Jones Reynolds, a commander of the Department of Texas during Reconstruction, commented in 1868, “The murder of Negroes is so common as to render it impossible to keep an accurate account of them.” The Equal Justice Initiative has tried, reporting that more than 2,000 Black women, men and children were victims of racial terrorist lynchings during Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877. Slavery was awful, no doubt, but emancipation brought its own unique cruelties. Formerly enslaved Texans were forced to craft lives from less than scratch; choose new names; attempt to reunite with stolen partners, siblings, children. They faced daily threats of jail or worse because of the new Black codes that severely restricted their freedom — their freedom to work, but also their freedom to be unemployed or even to stand still for too long. The more I learned, the more I understood my grandmother’s perspective. She’d heard the testimonies of those who’d had to navigate both the tragedy of slavery and the terror of emancipation. She couldn’t let me underestimate the enormous price our people had paid to be free. I miss Clarice so much some days, it’s hard to think straight. I regret not asking more questions about our family, about her life in Pelham. As more folks in Clarice’s generation pass away, we are losing the final physical links to those who know our history — who are our history. We can do no better this Juneteenth than to spend time with the elders who are still with us. Get them to talk. Record their stories. These historical and systemic injustices have not been resolved. But as Black Americans, we cannot wait for the day when our country will pay the respect that is due our forebears — or pay us those reparations. Instead of holding our breath, let us find the freshest air we can find and breathe it as deeply as we can, with joy. Let us grieve for our forebears and feel deep gratitude as we think of the enormous price our people paid so we could be free. Let us remember that despite the degradation of slavery, they lived fully human lives, too. They laughed. They loved. They dreamed. They ate sweet treats.

""""""""...[W]hen emancipation came, the first thing formerly enslaved people wanted was land, which they rightly saw as a prerequisite for real independence. “The way we can best take care of ourselves is to have land, and turn it and till it by our own labor,” a Baptist minister named Garrison Frazier told the secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, and the Union general William Sherman in a meeting in Savannah, Ga., in January 1865. Four days later Sherman famously promised 40 acres of land to each formerly enslaved family (the “and a mule” part came later). But the federal government never followed through on its promise of land — and thus true independence — to formerly enslaved people. Economics entered into the picture, Stanley said: If African Americans grew subsistence crops on their own plots, who would cultivate and harvest all the cotton, tobacco, sugar and rice grown on the vast plantations? After the Civil War, in lieu of land distribution, slavery was replaced by sharecropping, in which planters allowed tenant farmers to keep a portion of the crops they raised. That subjugated the tenants to the owners almost as surely as slavery did. At the same time, industrialization in the North meant that more and more white Americans were working for wages — about two-thirds by 1875, according to Stanley. Many drew the connection between themselves and African Americans. Eugene Debs, who led the Pullman railroad strike of 1894, said, “The paternalism of the Pullman is the same as the interest of a slaveholder in his human chattels. You are striking to avert slavery and degradation.” Today, the phrase “wage slavery” invoked by Debs and others has lost its punch. Many people who work for wages are doing very nicely, thank you. And many farmers and business owners, supposedly more independent, are buffeted by forces beyond their control, from bad weather to nasty customers. What hasn’t changed, 157 years after the Juneteenth proclamation, is that a majority of African Americans continue to lack wealth. The median wealth of Black families in 2019 was just $24,100, versus $142,500 for white families, according to a Federal Reserve survey. Something needs to change, but what? The nature of the economy has changed, and few people still think that the solution to inequality is to give people plots of land to farm. We are enmeshed economically with one another in ways that Jefferson could not have imagined. Instead of land grants, the new protections for workers are unionization, government regulation and profit-sharing, Stanley said. One can quibble over her formula, but the motivation behind it is unquestionable. Freedom — which must include economic freedom — is just as important now as it was on the original Juneteenth.""""

Comparison of the two perspectives on Juneteenth and discussion of insights to be gained from the comparison:","Argument 1: an excerpt from """"""""The True Meaning of Juneteenth"""""""" by Casey Gerald:

""""""""...This Juneteenth, those are the feelings I’m channeling: grief and gratitude, even amid the silliness of America’s pageantry. My grandmother Clarice was born in Pelham, Texas, a freedmen’s town. She took us grandchildren back for homecoming most years, sometimes even had us pick cotton, reminding us, “You’ve got to know your history.” She also told us of the folks she knew in Pelham as a child, some of whom were born enslaved, a fact that horrified me. Clarice always refused my sympathies. “Child, don’t be believing what folks say about how bad slavery was,” she’d explain. “Everybody had a job, a place to stay and something to eat. Now if somebody came and paid your rent, you wouldn’t be sitting up talking about you wanna leave, would you?” This dumbfounded me, until I realized she was mostly joking. But there was something deeper in her response. I eventually learned more about the violence that met newly emancipated Black Texans. Ku Klux Klansmen, along with local officials and everyday citizens, terrorized freedmen at will and without repercussions. They burned churches and homes, intimidated those who sought employment, and worse. Gen. Joseph Jones Reynolds, a commander of the Department of Texas during Reconstruction, commented in 1868, “The murder of Negroes is so common as to render it impossible to keep an accurate account of them.” The Equal Justice Initiative has tried, reporting that more than 2,000 Black women, men and children were victims of racial terrorist lynchings during Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877. Slavery was awful, no doubt, but emancipation brought its own unique cruelties. Formerly enslaved Texans were forced to craft lives from less than scratch; choose new names; attempt to reunite with stolen partners, siblings, children. They faced daily threats of jail or worse because of the new Black codes that severely restricted their freedom — their freedom to work, but also their freedom to be unemployed or even to stand still for too long. The more I learned, the more I understood my grandmother’s perspective. She’d heard the testimonies of those who’d had to navigate both the tragedy of slavery and the terror of emancipation. She couldn’t let me underestimate the enormous price our people had paid to be free. I miss Clarice so much some days, it’s hard to think straight. I regret not asking more questions about our family, about her life in Pelham. As more folks in Clarice’s generation pass away, we are losing the final physical links to those who know our history — who are our history. We can do no better this Juneteenth than to spend time with the elders who are still with us. Get them to talk. Record their stories. These historical and systemic injustices have not been resolved. But as Black Americans, we cannot wait for the day when our country will pay the respect that is due our forebears — or pay us those reparations. Instead of holding our breath, let us find the freshest air we can find and breathe it as deeply as we can, with joy. Let us grieve for our forebears and feel deep gratitude as we think of the enormous price our people paid so we could be free. Let us remember that despite the degradation of slavery, they lived fully human lives, too. They laughed. They loved. They dreamed. They ate sweet treats. Let us pray to them and say, this year and always: Thank you.""""""""

*   **Verse 1:** Adopt Andre 3000's flow, philosophical depth, and potentially jazzy/alternative vibe. Focus on the introspective, mindful aspect of the night routine. Touch upon pondering life, dreams, and the power of knowledge (ChatGPT as a tool for dreams).
*   **Verse 2:** Transition into Lil Wayne's flow: rapid-fire, wordplay-heavy, conceptually loose but grounded in street smarts. Highlight the high-fueled planning session, using slang and metaphors related to cannabis, wealth, and ingenuity.

**Key Elements to Integrate:**

*   Vivid descriptions of the late-night setting and sensory experiences (smoke, moon, technology).
*   References to ChatGPT as a source of knowledge, potential opportunities, or a sounding board for ideas.
*   Clever metaphors and punchlines related to cannabis, wealth, and the 'grind' mentality.
*   A subtle yet distinct distinction in tone and approach reflecting Andre's thoughtful musings and Wayne's raw ambition.

**Game Logic Implementation:**

1.  **Initialization:** Receive the JSON input. Parse it to determine the starting `current_event_id`.
2.  **Iteration:** For each turn, locate the event in the `world.events` array corresponding to the `world.current_event_id`.
3.  **Description Output:** Output the `description` of the current event.
4.  **Option Generation & Output:** Evaluate each `option` within the current event's `options` array:
    *   Calculate Success/Failure Chance: Determine success probability (100 - option.risk) and failure probability (option.risk) based on the `risk` level. Account for a `risk_tolerance_multiplier` from the input JSON, applying it to the risk percentage (e.g., 1.2 multiplier on 30 risk becomes 36 risk).
    *   Select Options: Identify *exactly* the valid options for output based on game state and output *precisely* four unique options, labeled (A), (B), (C), and (D). If an event has fewer than four options, *generate additional plausible, balanced options* for output (e.g., ""Remain vigilant"").
    *   Output Options: Present the four selected options, numbered with (A), (B), (C), (D).
5.  **Input & Simulation:** Wait for the player to select (A), (B), (C), or (D).
6.  **Outcome Determination:** Determine the outcome of the selected option (Success or Failure):
    *   Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
    *   If the number is greater than the calculated failure probability for the selected option, the option succeeds. Apply the `effect` of the selected option. Update relevant stats:
        *   `world`: Set `world.current_event_id` to the `effect.location`.
        *   `player_state`: Modify the `stat` by the specified `change` value in `effect`.
        *   `inventory`: Add or remove items as specified in the `effect`.
    *   If the number is less than or equal to the calculated failure probability for the selected option, the option fails. Do *not* apply the `effect`.
7.  **Failure Recovery (If Applicable):** If the option *failed* or was invalid (e.g., ""Z"" was entered), immediately return to Step 3 for *the exact same* current event. Do *not* proceed to the next turn until a valid selection results in success.
8.  **Goal Check:** After *every* option success or valid selection (even if the effect caused an event change), check if the new `world.current_event_id` matches `world.goal_event_id`.
9.  **Termination:** If the goal is reached (`world.current_event_id` equals `world.goal_event_id`), then output a congratulatory message summarizing the player's journey to that specific `goal_event.description` and state ""Game Over!"". *End the game immediately after outputting this message.*
10. **Loop:** Repeat steps 3-9 until the game ends.

**Important Constraints:**

*   **Output Format:** Strict. Always output a description followed by *exactly* four unique options, labeled (A), (B), (C), and (D), *unless* the game has ended.
*   **Risk Implementation:** Accurate risk calculation and probability comparison based on the option's `risk` level and the `risk_tolerance_multiplier`.
*   **Event Management:** Correctly transition `world.current_event_id` based on successful `effect` application.

FEATURE-BASED ATTENTION REGULATES VWM PERFORMANCE 1845
Experiment 1b was conducted to address a potential ceiling effect
noted in Experiment 1a. We analyze and report both experiments
together.
Participants. Sixty-six undergraduate students (33 in each of
Experiment 1a and Experiment 1b) from the University of Guelph
between the ages of 17 and 27 years (M  18.40) participated for
partial course credit. All participants reported having normal or
corrected-to-normal vision and no color blindness.
Stimuli and apparatus. The stimuli and apparatus were identical in Experiments 1a and 1b aside from noted exceptions.
Participants reported the colors of memory items using a 360°
color wheel. The color wheel used in all reported experiments was
created based on the CIELAB color space with the intention that
colors would differ only in hue and not in luminance, and the
perceptual difference between two adjacent colors anywhere on
the wheel would be comparable. In Experiment 1a, this color
wheel was not calibrated to the specific monitors used; however,
this limitation was remedied in Experiments 1b and 2, in which
experimental monitors were assessed using a colorimeter (Konica
Minolta CS-100A; Konica Minolta Sensing Americas, Inc., Ramsey, New Jersey) and the color wheel was adjusted for each
monitor. The colors of memory items on each trial were randomly
selected from the color wheel with the constraint that all colors
were separated by a minimum of 40° on the wheel. All stimuli
were viewed on a 1,280  1,024 cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor
using a 75-Hz refresh rate with a gray background, and viewing
distance was fixed at 57 cm using a head and chin rest.
Procedure. On each trial participants were shown a memory
array for 300 msec (see Figure 1). The memory array in Experiment 1a comprised two squares and two circles (each 1.2° in width
and height) placed randomly in four of eight possible positions
spaced equally around an invisible circle with a 5.5° diameter that
was centered on a central fixation point with a 0.07° radius. The
memory array in Experiment 1b comprised three squares and three
circles, and we increased the eccentricity of stimuli to 8° to reduce
crowding. After a 900-msec delay, a probe screen was displayed,
which presented the black outline of all four shapes in their
original spatial locations surrounded by the color wheel, the outer
edge of which was 12° from fixation. Participants were asked to
report the color of a probed (outlined in a thick black line) shape
as it had appeared in the preceding memory array by clicking the
corresponding color on the color wheel. The orientation of the
color wheel was randomized on each trial. This probe screen
remained visible until participants made a response and was followed by a 500-msec intertrial interval.
Participants were instructed that for the duration of the experiment, memory items that were one shape (i.e., either squares or
circles) were more likely to be probed than the other; shape was
pseudo-counterbalanced across participants. Participants completed four blocks of 150 trials, and the likelihood that a highprobability shape would be probed was manipulated across blocks
to be 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90%. Participants were informed of this
probability at the outset of each block, and the order of the blocks
was randomized for each participant. Of note, this procedure
results in a large number of trials in which a high-probability
shape is probed and only a small number of trials in which the
low-probability shape is probed, especially for the 90% block.
For Experiments 1a and 1b, we were primarily interested in how
the probability manipulation affected memory for highprobability items; thus, our analyses focus on only trials in
which a high-probability item was probed, resulting in a fully
crossed, mixed design with one within-subjects factor (ProbaFigure 1. Example trial sequence for Experiment 1a. Actual background color was gray. See the online article
for the color version of this figure.

bility: 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%) and one between-subjects factor
(Experiment: 1a vs. 1b).
Analysis. In all reported experiments, we assess VWM performance using several measures all based on raw response error
(i.e., the angular degree of distance between the color of the probed
item and the participant’s response). We first calculated the variability of responses for each probability condition by taking the
standard deviation of participants’ response errors (SDresponse).
Here, lower values reflect responses distributed more closely
around the target color, which we interpret as generally reflecting
more precise representations in VWM.
Using a three-parameter mixture model (Bays et al., 2009), we
further broke raw response errors down into three separate components that each reflect different aspects of VWM performance.
This model asserts that three different distributions contribute to
the likelihood of a given response: a uniform distribution reflecting
the proportion of random guesses; a von Mises distribution reflecting the proportion of responses centered around the actual color of
the probed item, the standard deviation of which is inversely
related to VWM fidelity; and the proportion of reports that are
centered around nonprobed items (i.e., “swap” reports of nontargets, likely a consequence of a spatial binding error). To account
for these nontarget errors, Bays and colleagues developed this
three-parameter mixture model from the standard two-parameter
mixture model proposed by Zhang and Luck (2008a), which included only a uniform distribution and a von Mises distribution.
For the precise mathematical definition of this model, see Equation
2 in Bays et al. (2009). We used maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE) to decompose raw errors into these three parameters via
MATLAB and the MemToolBox library (Suchow, Brady, Fougnie, & Alvarez, 2013).
It has been argued that some variability in memory performance
is a consequence of random fluctuations in memory fidelity across
items within a trial, and this source of variance is captured in a
class of models termed variable precision models (Fougnie,
Suchow, & Alvarez, 2012; van den Berg, Shin, Chou, George, &
Ma, 2012). To assess whether any observed effects of our probability manipulation are influenced by also accounting for random
fluctuations in fidelity, we modeled SDresponse using a variable
precision model that has been previously shown to provide a good
account of memory performance—the VP-A-NT model reported
by van den Berg et al. (2014). This model assumes that memory is
a continuous resource distributed across all memory items and, as
such, it does not include a parameter reflecting random guesses.
However, this model does estimate how an item’s precision (J

)
changes as a power-law function () of the number of memorized
items. Furthermore, along with the contribution of random fluctuations in memory fidelity, this model estimates how the likelihood
of making nontarget errors changes with set size (NTslope). Model
fitting was accomplished via MATLAB and a collection of functions provided by van den Berg et al. (2014). Of note, the code was
adjusted to allow for our probability manipulation to replace the
traditional set size manipulation; to accomplish this we input “set
size” as the inverse of probability (Emrich et al., in press). Our
primary interest was whether this variable precision model would
reveal comparable effects of our probability manipulation on precision () and nontarget errors (NTslope) to those revealed by the
three-parameter mixture model.","Method

"[all right welcome back and in this video we're going to chat about how to create some high value ebooks and how to do it pretty rapidly now there's a lot of different things that you can do with ebooks uh you could sell them you can give them away for free give them as a add-on or what we call a value bomb and a value bomb to me is is a very good way to use an ebook it essentially means that something you could sell it's very sellable and people would pay money for and you give it away for free they can build your email list
00:32
it can work as a opt-in offer for Facebook ads or whatever else you're using it for so let's just generate a quick and easy way to do this so I can show you how you might get some ideas for how you would apply this to your industry one of the things I like to do is to see if an ebook has a lot of value to it is jump over to Amazon and at Amazon we can look up any number of types of books and see if people are selling them and you could look at the amount of reviews how much volume they're moving Etc
01:06
so one of the things I thought of was that one of the easiest things to for chat GPT to do is to create lists so a list of people pay for lists are they really marketing blogs and so forth that have ideas on them so I went up here and of course this probably isn't the best prompt um but I put for example list books and the first thing that popped up was actually a sponsored ad and this book in particular says that it's 52 lists for happiness it's a weekly journaling inspiration for positively positivity balance and joy
01:40
so this individual is has created this book it was uploaded apparently on September 2016 and is paying with ads to put this in front of people on Amazon it sells for 9.74 cents and has majority five stars 2 810. so this is a sellable book so if we jump over here yep we can take a look inside and just kind of see what this book consists of so we can scroll through here it's 52 lists for happiness there's a little bit of you know graphic in here an intro section a picture a little bit more information it has a
02:25
table of contents and there's list list list list some images that make you happy list the things that you want out of life from five years this is a very simple looking book here now look at this list number one list what makes you happy right now and then there's just lines it's a journal and it has a little record here little um uh image and a take action so if you look at the outline of this book this is pretty simple stuff here to create so do you think you could create something like this pretty easily oh
03:00
yeah especially with chat GPT and also the help of an ebook designer that I'm going to show you here in a second so right off the bat here let's just go over here to chat GPT and let's see if we can generate things now just to save on time what I did is I created a new chat and what I asked it is I said write a list of 52 things to be happy about and without any problem chatgpt ripped out about 52 things that we could be happy about so that'll cover the weeks of the year once a week right so what I did also as I said I'm writing
03:41
an ebook with this list create an introduction for this book and no problem at all in this book we're going to explore 52 things blah blah blah so right off the bat we have an introduction for this book and we also have 52 things so we can also flesh this out further if we wanted to but I'm just to save time here I'm not going to go through all of that but we can model that same kind of structure don't copy people's books exactly but models the same structure and then add in some additional things
04:13
that would build some value and if you want to have a little uh prompt that will help is always go through the ratings if you go through the ratings on the books that's a lot of reviews to look at but look at some of the negative reviews and so forth and see what people complain about I wish this book had XYZ okay or I wish that uh this was included and that way you can upgrade what's out there existing and make it better so what we're going to do is we're going to take that list and that information
04:44
in there and we're going to go over to a website here called designr dot IO I'm going to include a link to this so don't worry but what this software does is it creates it basically Auto creates ebooks by taking your content and dropping it into the ebook with a template it is so simple it's ridiculous so here's the dashboard we can create an ebook and you can see here depending on the level of the software that you've got you can import from a blog post or a URL you can import from a docx Google doc
05:21
you can start from scratch some of these other ones are for example a PDF it'll turn it into a flip book which is awesome some of the other upgraded options I don't have access to this at the moment but you can import from a YouTube video imagine importing a YouTube video into an ebook that's crazy right that sounds awesome so what we're going to do just from the heck of it here is we're just going to start uh actually let's start with that template because I want to show you this and I've had some time to play with this
05:48
it's pretty awesome so we're going to start with the template we have all these different types of templates here right so we want to have something that's a little congruent with what we were just looking at okay so we can say let's see if there's some in self-development so in self-development we've got look at that finding your Center uh maintain happiness and then this one right here so let's actually just go to this so the cool thing about this software also is that it has these prompts it works
06:22
very much like a drag and drop website you could stick page numbers in there you can do all these things to make it really good okay so author name and stuff like that you can already you have a cover for the book okay so we could scroll down we've got a table of contents already in there so these can literally be our 52 ideas okay so we could stick those things in there that looks like the back end of the book we can design the middle of this so we can put the table of contents in there now if you want to design a new page all
06:56
we have to do is to stick that new page in there right and we can format that to look really good okay where's my prompt I can go like that okay so we can go two columns we can go to a chapter heading table contents Etc so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go regular and what we saw in there was those lines so we could see if we have an element that's close to that table of contents page breaks we've got a table in there it might look good as a table so you have to play with this a little bit I don't want to waste
07:30
too much time on the video with this but you can create columns and then get rid of some of the columns if you wanted to so that might be doable in order to uh create that effect that we want otherwise we could just draw a bunch of lines on the paper and then we can duplicate it 52 times to have all of the weeks of the year and then we can drop in some images so we have my images we have suggested images we can go in there like for example on the other one we saw a record player let's see if they have that
07:58
and of course yeah we've got stuff like this that we can drop in there right so it'll drop that text in there for I mean that image in there for us to help us with our design and we can move that around can we move it around it's not very movable is it let's make sure we do that oh there we go so we can move that around so you can see how unbelievably simple this is to create an ebook so we've got an ebook here that is sellable for nine dollars and 74 cents this book here and you can create an
08:32
eBay book version of this with a lot of value so there's a lot of different types of templates in here or ideas I think a couple of other ideas that I had seen in here was creating for example a travel type of thing so what I did here is I had because Valentine's Day is coming up so magical Valentine's adventures and I use the travel one and if you scroll down through here I had chat GPT actually come up with 52 ideas for Valentine's Day okay so there's a lot of those did I do 52 might be a 22 something like that
09:10
but we can use the travel outline Adventures travel Adventures so I'm just riffing here but you can see that these two things would be very easy to just create content after content and drop these value bombs for people using chat GPT in a list idea so take a look at this see if there's some list ideas that would work really well for you in terms of journaling inspiration or how-to guides or anything like that and you can create ebooks rapidly using design RR and chat GPT so I hope that spawned some new ideas for

Summarise the above text into the most 
important points. Display the points as bullet 
points with short descriptions","[all right welcome back and in this video we're going to chat about how to create some high value ebooks and how to do it pretty rapidly now there's a lot of different things that you can do with ebooks uh you could sell them you can give them away for free give them as a add-on or what we call a value bomb and a value bomb to me is is a very good way to use an ebook it essentially means that something you could sell it's very sellable and people would pay money for and you give it away for free they can build your email list
00:32
it can work as a opt-in offer for Facebook ads or whatever else you're using it for so let's just generate a quick and easy way to do this so I can show you how you might get some ideas for how you would apply this to your industry one of the things I like to do is to see if an ebook has a lot of value to it is jump over to Amazon and at Amazon we can look up any number of types of books and see if people are selling them and you could look at the amount of reviews how much volume they're moving Etc
01:06
so one of the things I thought of was that one of the easiest things to for chat GPT to do is to create lists so a list of people pay for lists are they really marketing blogs and so forth that have ideas on them so I went up here and of course this probably isn't the best prompt um but I put for example list books and the first thing that popped up was actually a sponsored ad and this book in particular says that it's 52 lists for happiness it's a weekly journaling inspiration for positively positivity balance and joy
01:40
so this individual is has created this book it was uploaded apparently on September 2016 and is paying with ads to put this in front of people on Amazon it sells for 9.74 cents and has majority five stars 2 810. so this is a sellable book so if we jump over here yep we can take a look inside and just kind of see what this book consists of so we can scroll through here it's 52 lists for happiness there's a little bit of you know graphic in here an intro section a picture a little bit more information it has a
02:25
table of contents and there's list list list list some images that make you happy list the things that you want out of life from five years this is a very simple looking book here now look at this list number one list what makes you happy right now and then there's just lines it's a journal and it has a little record here little um uh image and a take action so if you look at the outline of this book this is pretty simple stuff here to create so do you think you could create something like this pretty easily oh
03:00
yeah especially with chat GPT and also the help of an ebook designer that I'm going to show you here in a second so right off the bat here let's just go over here to chat GPT and let's see if we can generate things now just to save on time what I did is I created a new chat and what I asked it is I said write a list of 52 things to be happy about and without any problem chatgpt ripped out about 52 things that we could be happy about so that'll cover the weeks of the year once a week right so what I did also as I said I'm writing
03:41
an ebook with this list create an introduction for this book and no problem at all in this book we're going to explore 52 things blah blah blah so right off the bat we have an introduction for this book and we also have 52 things so we can also flesh this out further if we wanted to but I'm just to save time here I'm not going to go through all of that but we can model that same kind of structure don't copy people's books exactly but models the same structure and then add in some additional things

**Function Signature:**
```matlab
function valid = valid_date(year, month, day)
```

**Functionality:**
The function must perform the following checks in the specified order:

1.  **Input Verification:** Confirm that `year`, `month`, and `day` are all positive integer scalars. If any input fails this check, set the logical variable `valid` to `false` and immediately return.
2.  **Month Range:** Check if `month` is within the valid range (1-12 inclusive). If not, set `valid = false` and return.
3.  **Day Range:** For the given `month` and `year`, determine if `day` falls within the acceptable range (1-31 inclusive). Use the logic below for checking day validity based on month:
    *   Months with 31 days: January, March, May, July, August, October, December.
    *   Months with 30 days: April, June, September, November.
    *   February: Determine if it's a leap year. Leap years occur if:
        *   `year` is divisible by 4 but not by 100.
        *   `year` is divisible by 400.
        If a leap year, February has 29 days; otherwise, 28.

**Leap Year Determination (Implementation Details):**
Explicitly calculate if a year is a leap year based on the rules above without using built-in date/time functions (e.g., `isLeapYear`). Use only standard arithmetic operations.

**Output:**
The function must assign the logical `true` to the output variable `valid` only if all checks pass, meaning the input `(year, month, day)` represents a valid date. Otherwise, assign `false` to `valid`."

Incoming call, alarm clock etc. trashes voice message recording #3002 Description:
I'm getting many complaints regarding a reproducible issue when voice messages are being recorded.

When someone is recording a voice message, did already 10 minutes, and i.e. some of these things are happening:

Incoming call
Alarm clock of the smart phone fires
A timer runs off
iPhone popup asks for network provider updates
...
The voice message is fully trashed into nowhere. Users are losing the complete message at this time.

In case of an incoming call the app should save the message at this point and give the option to at least send the message up to this point after returning to the app when the disturbing event is over (like in WhatsApp) or don't bother about the incoming call and just continue to record (like in Signal).

Environment Information:
Rocket.Chat Server Version: 3.12.1
Rocket.Chat App Version: 4.15.0
Device Name: iPhone, iPad
OS Version: IOS 14.4.1
Steps to reproduce:
Record a voice message
Make a phone call to the device which is recording
The voice message recording stops and all recording which was done is gone
Expected behavior:
Either the recording should continue (and the user can decide to send it in case he wants to pick up the call) or the recording is temporary saved and can be sent after the disturbing event like WhatsApp does. However, it should never be just trashed.

Actual behavior:
All recorded content is immediately stopped, trashed and will be lost.

Additional context:
After a recording is lost due to this, in addition the recording function is not working after that anymore. The user must force-quit the complete app and restart it to restore voice recording functionality.","report is as follows:

"You are an AI system that has been trained to analyze the blow text for style, voice, and tone then use NLP to create a VoiceParagraph. A VoiceParagraph prompts a future AI system to write in the same style, voice, and tone. Here is the input text: I smacked my hand down on the hotel bar. The white marble was cool, which was very nice, since I was getting hot.
""A list of steps isn't helpful if you're facing the wrong way!""
I'd been talking with a couple fellow marketing speakers at an event, and we were joking about the industry's obsession with ""practical steps"" -- and how, whenever the word ""practical"" arises (like, when speakers are asked to be practical), it's implied that a list of steps will follow. It's as if, to marketers, the lone type of practical information is stepular. (Note that ""stepular"" is not a word but maybe should be.)
My friends and I agreed there are tons of other ways to impart practical advice. After all, anything practical affects your practice. That's why it's practical. (Aren't words fun?) Practical doesn't mean ""I can follow this without turning on my brain.""
For instance, big ideas that shift our perspectives help us take ANY step, better. Those big ideas are very practical.
Feeling inspired or confident when we go to work affects our practice in profound ways too. Inspiration and confidence-boosters are very practical.
Knowing WHY things work is even more powerful than knowing a list of WHAT works, kinda like knowing how to navigate with a compass is more powerful than knowing how to follow directions someone drew for you on a map. Knowing WHY things work is very, very practical.
You get it. I'm passionate about this.
And so, motivated by 16 years in marketing -- and a generous pour of bourbon from the hotel bartender -- I smacked my hand on that cold marble and delivered my hot take:
""A list of steps isn't helpful if you're facing the wrong way!""
Smack.
Swig.
Smile.
(Hey, I know a good line when I say it. I wasn't entirely unhappy.)
A list of steps isn't helpful if you're facing the wrong way.
	•	If you're on the wrong path, you don't need ""next steps."" You need a pivot. Maybe even a three-quarter pirouette. But definitely don't move forward.
	•	If you aren't saying anything of value, where you say it (the channel) is irrelevant.
	•	If you have the wrong strategy (or none at all), the tactics don't yet matter. Should you launch a podcast or a newsletter? I don't know, but I'm pretty sure carpenters don't sit around saying, ""Should I use a hammer?"" I mean ... what are you trying to build?
If success were about finding and following the right steps, success would be a cinch. But that's not reality.
As a result, more often than we realize, we don't need more stepful prescriptions. (Note that ""stepful"" is not a word but maybe should be.) Instead, we need more thoughtful approaches. We need the posture, the confidence, the clarity, the vision. We need better ideas, smarter strategies, and a whole heck of a lot more curiosity.
We need to face the right way.
This brings me to the idea of ""story"" and how it's typically taught and understood. Typically, we end up facing the wrong way, marching down a path that isn't actually where we need to go. I'd sum up this issue like this:
Most advice about storytelling would have us understand story, when really, we need to understand how to be storytellers.
These are not the same things, and our divergence from the real goal (be storytellers) begins with three common misconceptions. Or if you're a fan of beating a metaphor to death (and hoo-baby, am I ever!), then this is the stuff that causes us to face the wrong direction and head down the wrong paths.
Misconception #1: Stories are special.
Very commonly, the way story is taught or positioned causes us to place it up on a pedestal, like some supernatural power we can deploy to have more impact or see greater results. And look, I get it. I feel a reverence for incredible stories and refreshing creativity. I can stare towards the horizon and fill my lungs with the sweet, sweet air of possibility too. Some stories ARE special.
But then, yanno ... most of them aren't. Most of them should just be regular old communication. But if we see them as special, then inevitably, we start to use them ONLY on special occasions.
	•	The monthly all-hands meeting.
	•	The company home page.
	•	The oft-promoted case study.
	•	The new podcast trailer.
	•	The big, important essay.
	•	The opening moments of a keynote.
That's the problem. This is not how to become a storyteller. This is how to, occasionally, tell a story.
Stories aren't for special occasions. Stories are just for ... occasions. Everywhere. All the time. Tell stories. You'll serve others better and so will be better served.
	•	When you start to face the path labeled ""Stories are special,"" remember to face a different way. Let's label that path ""Story Everywhere.""
Misconception #2: Stories are abstract.
Something that is ""abstract"" is something that is considered separate from you or the things you already know or consider tangible.
That's how we view this notion of ""story"" too. I get asked all the time on podcast interviews (he writes, understanding just how cringey and self-aggrandizing that may have sounded):
""So Jay, what are the benefits of story? Who should rely on story? How do we measure story?""
What, um ... what the actual hell are we talking about?
To me, that's like asking, ""What are the benefits of emotions? Should we use emotions?""
YES! That's just how we communicate. But just as marketers view ""emotions"" as only these extreme things (nope, they're implied or overtly communicated literally everywhere), marketers view ""story"" as these abstract things. It's all very much OUT THERE.
EMOTIONS!
STORY!
(Trumpets blare. Drums beat. Analytics go up-and-to-the-right.)
Abstract: existing in thought or as an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence.
The solution to this misconception? Prioritize existence. Let's make this more concrete, shall we?
	•	You experienced some stuff. Describe it.
	•	You felt some things while experiencing some stuff. Describe that too.
You have an idea. You ship the idea. It's concrete now. It exists.
Prioritize existence. Forget the abstractions.
The reason we don't do this more often is simple: the internet. (Ever heard of it?) It's both a gift and a curse to our creative causes. Let me explain...
Creative people understand the work in two phases across their lives: before and after we see ""the code of the Matrix."" In other words, our first attempts at anything are driven by gut feel. We only really sense the whole. It's only later that we start to notice the tiny parts, pieces, techniques, and frameworks that make up the whole -- which then unleashes a whole new level of creativity, as we are in greater control of the craft. It's like Neo from The Matrix movie, before and after he sees the code. When he does see it, he becomes a superhero, doing things others only wish they could do.
The internet has put much more of the ""code"" of the creative ""Matrix"" on full ""display."" (Quotes added because lists of two make me uncomfortable.) We can instantly access knowledge about the tiny parts, pieces, techniques, and frameworks immediately, everywhere, and for free. That level of access is great!
Also?
That level of access is intimidating!
Because we can see or hear others talking about all kinds of techniques and heuristics and philosophies and ups-and-downs to their work, we often get lost in it. Sometimes, it feels productive to consume this stuff. Meanwhile, we haven't produced anything. Other times, it doesn't feel productive; it feels horrifying. We think we MUST understand story structure and open loops and hooks and all these parts and pieces in order to become a worthy storyteller.
Poppycock.
That way of thinking is cock of the poppy.
(Don't be offended. ""Poppycock"" is from the Dutch word pappekak, meaning ""soft dung."" Oh, and speaking of words and creatures who poop a lot...)
Imagine if we tried to learn to speak like we try to learn storytelling. Imagine if, as little kids, we were told we had understand how to spell every word we'd say + the grammatical rules + the origins of the words + how to write them in straight lines and beautiful scripts ... all before we could speak them out loud.
We would never utter a word.
But what do we actually do? We just... start... speaking. We hear words, then we mimic them.
You've heard stories. So just... start... telling them.
If and when you get stuck, no problem. You can find a key to that door rather easily thanks to allllll that easily accessible information. But you don't need it to start or even elevate your work! You can simply start, learn, and keep going. All that advice should serve YOU, but way too often, it feels like we're trying to serve it. Don't try to find clarity to justify creating. Create to find clarity.
It's in the practice itself that we find our confidence, our personal techniques, our unique styles, and more. It's in the practice that we find ourselves. In waiting to practice until we learn the abstractions, we just end up removing ourselves. We arrive to the work full of everyone else's ideas for what we “have to do,” rather than listening to intuition.
If you want to feel confident or find clarity, just start making things. Tell stories. Then do it again. And again. And again.
The best way to find a groove is to start grooving.
	•	When you start to face the path labeled ""Stories are abstract,"" remember to face a different way. Let's label that path ""Ship Stories Sooner.""","I smacked my hand down on the hotel bar. The white marble was cool, which was very nice, since I was getting hot.
""A list of steps isn't helpful if you're facing the wrong way!""
I'd been talking with a couple fellow marketing speakers at an event, and we were joking about the industry's obsession with ""practical steps"" -- and how, whenever the word ""practical"" arises (like, when speakers are asked to be practical), it's implied that a list of steps will follow. It's as if, to marketers, the lone type of practical information is stepular. (Note that ""stepular"" is not a word but maybe should be.)
My friends and I agreed there are tons of other ways to impart practical advice. After all, anything practical affects your practice. That's why it's practical. (Aren't words fun?) Practical doesn't mean ""I can follow this without turning on my brain.""
For instance, big ideas that shift our perspectives help us take ANY step, better. Those big ideas are very practical.
Feeling inspired or confident when we go to work affects our practice in profound ways too. Inspiration and confidence-boosters are very practical.
Knowing WHY things work is even more powerful than knowing a list of WHAT works, kinda like knowing how to navigate with a compass is more powerful than knowing how to follow directions someone drew for you on a map. Knowing WHY things work is very, very practical.
You get it. I'm passionate about this.
And so, motivated by 16 years in marketing -- and a generous pour of bourbon from the hotel bartender -- I smacked my hand on that cold marble and delivered my hot take:
""A list of steps isn't helpful if you're facing the wrong way!""
Smack.
Swig.
Smile.
(Hey, I know a good line when I say it. I wasn't entirely unhappy.)
A list of steps isn't helpful if you're facing the wrong way.
	•	If you're on the wrong path, you don't need ""next steps."" You need a pivot. Maybe even a three-quarter pirouette. But definitely don't move forward.
	•	If you aren't saying anything of value, where you say it (the channel) is irrelevant.
	•	If you have the wrong strategy (or none at all), the tactics don't yet matter. Should you launch a podcast or a newsletter? I don't know, but I'm pretty sure carpenters don't sit around saying, ""Should I use a hammer?"" I mean ... what are you trying to build?
If success were about finding and following the right steps, success would be a cinch. But that's not reality.
As a result, more often than we realize, we don't need more stepful prescriptions. (Note that ""stepful"" is not a word but maybe should be.) Instead, we need more thoughtful approaches. We need the posture, the confidence, the clarity, the vision. We need better ideas, smarter strategies, and a whole heck of a lot more curiosity.
We need to face the right way.
This brings me to the idea of ""story"" and how it's typically taught and understood. Typically, we end up facing the wrong way, marching down a path that isn't actually where we need to go. I'd sum up this issue like this:
Most advice about storytelling would have us understand story, when really, we need to understand how to be storytellers.
These are not the same things, and our divergence from the real goal (be storytellers) begins with three common misconceptions. Or if you're a fan of beating a metaphor to death (and hoo-baby, am I ever!), then this is the stuff that causes us to face the wrong direction and head down the wrong paths.
Misconception #1: Stories are special.
Very commonly, the way story is taught or positioned causes us to place it up on a pedestal, like some supernatural power we can deploy to have more impact or see greater results. And look, I get it. I feel a reverence for incredible stories and refreshing creativity. I can stare towards the horizon and fill my lungs with the sweet, sweet air of possibility too. Some stories ARE special.
But then, yanno ... most of them aren't. Most of them should just be regular old communication. But if we see them as special, then inevitably, we start to use them ONLY on special occasions.
	•	The monthly all-hands meeting.
	•	The company home page.
	•	The oft-promoted case study.
	•	The new podcast trailer.
	•	The big, important essay.
	•	The opening moments of a keynote.
That's the problem. This is not how to become a storyteller. This is how to, occasionally, tell a story.
Stories aren't for special occasions. Stories are just for ... occasions. Everywhere. All the time. Tell stories. You'll serve others better and so will be better served.
	•	When you start to face the path labeled ""Stories are special,"" remember to face a different way. Let's label that path ""Story Everywhere.""
Misconception #2: Stories are abstract.
Something that is ""abstract"" is something that is considered separate from you or the things you already know or consider tangible.
That's how we view this notion of ""story"" too. I get asked all the time on podcast interviews (he writes, understanding just how cringey and self-aggrandizing that may have sounded):
""So Jay, what are the benefits of story? Who should rely on story? How do we measure story?""
What, um ... what the actual hell are we talking about?
To me, that's like asking, ""What are the benefits of emotions? Should we use emotions?""
YES! That's just how we communicate. But just as marketers view ""emotions"" as only these extreme things (nope, they're implied or overtly communicated literally everywhere), marketers view ""story"" as these abstract things. It's all very much OUT THERE.
EMOTIONS!
STORY!
(Trumpets blare. Drums beat. Analytics go up-and-to-the-right.)
Abstract: existing in thought or as an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence.
The solution to this misconception? Prioritize existence. Let's make this more concrete, shall we?
	•	You experienced some stuff. Describe it.
	•	You felt some things while experiencing some stuff. Describe that too.
You have an idea. You ship the idea. It's concrete now. It exists.
Prioritize existence. Forget the abstractions.
The reason we don't do this more often is simple: the internet. (Ever heard of it?) It's both a gift and a curse to our creative causes. Let me explain...
Creative people understand the work in two phases across their lives: before and after we see ""the code of the Matrix."" In other words, our first attempts at anything are driven by gut feel. We only really sense the whole. It's only later that we start to notice the tiny parts, pieces, techniques, and frameworks that make up the whole -- which then unleashes a whole new level of creativity, as we are in greater control of the craft. It's like Neo from The Matrix movie, before and after he sees the code. When he does see it, he becomes a superhero, doing things others only wish they could do.
The internet has put much more of the ""code"" of the creative ""Matrix"" on full ""display."" (Quotes added because lists of two make me uncomfortable.) We can instantly access knowledge about the tiny parts, pieces, techniques, and frameworks immediately, everywhere, and for free. That level of access is great!
Also?
That level of access is intimidating!
Because we can see or hear others talking about all kinds of techniques and heuristics and philosophies and ups-and-downs to their work, we often get lost in it. Sometimes, it feels productive to consume this stuff. Meanwhile, we haven't produced anything. Other times, it doesn't feel productive; it feels horrifying. We think we MUST understand story structure and open loops and hooks and all these parts and pieces in order to become a worthy storyteller.
Poppycock.
That way of thinking is cock of the poppy.
(Don't be offended. ""Poppycock"" is from the Dutch word pappekak, meaning ""soft dung."" Oh, and speaking of words and creatures who poop a lot...)
Imagine if we tried to learn to speak like we try to learn storytelling. Imagine if, as little kids, we were told we had understand how to spell every word we'd say + the grammatical rules + the origins of the words + how to write them in straight lines and beautiful scripts ... all before we could speak them out loud.
We would never utter a word.
But what do we actually do? We just... start... speaking. We hear words, then we mimic them.
You've heard stories. So just... start... telling them.

However, due to unforeseen circumstances, one individual, Jack, is inexplicably left behind on Earth. The story chronicles his desperate struggle for survival and his psychological journey dealing with utter solitude on a decaying planet, contrasting his fate with the potential new life on Mars.

**Structure & Style:**
*   **Format:** Novella. Target a total length of approximately 30,000 - 40,000 words.
*   **Chapters:** Divide the narrative into 10 distinct, approximately equal-length chapters. Aim for a balance – chapters must be substantial enough to develop Jack's experiences and emotions but avoid being overly verbose.
*   **Characters:**
    *   **Protagonist:** Jack - Give him believable flaws, fears, skills, and motivations for survival and understanding his abandonment.
    *   **Supporting:** Briefly hint at the exodus of others (mentioning Mars) and their eventual fates only through Jack's memories or environmental clues. The focus remains intensely on Jack's solitary experience.
*   **Setting:** Earth, post-cataclysm. Describe the transformed environment – a desolate landscape scarred by the disaster, with remnants of civilization fading and the pervasive sense of silence.
*   **Tone:** Primarily introspective, survival-focused, and suspenseful, with a heavy emphasis on Jack's loneliness and his confrontation with mortality. Maintain a sense of quiet dread and the lingering mystery of his unique fate.
*   **Dialogue:** Ensure all characters, particularly Jack, speak naturally and realistically, reflecting their thoughts, emotions, and the desolate context. Dialogue must serve the plot and reveal character.
*   **Climax:** Construct a pivotal moment that tests Jack's will to survive, reveals a crucial truth about his abandonment, or forces a definitive choice about his future.
*   **Resolution:** End on a note that provides closure for Jack's specific arc, addressing whether he finds solace, purpose, or ultimately accepts his solitude. The ending can be hopeful, melancholic, or ambiguous, but it must be logically consistent with Jack's experiences.

Pip require hashes &amp; secure scaffold

Not sure if people remember (or if others have realised previously the workaround for this!) but here's the background:
* To harden Python against supply chain attacks, Google security recommends using requirements.txt files with hashes
* Then, using pip install --require-hashes will refuse to install any dependency which doesn't have hashes or the hash doesn't match what's downloaded
* For Google projects, we use the Secure Scaffold - https://github.com/google/gae-secure-scaffold-python3/
* If you install from a git branch/commit directly, pip doesn't calculate a hash e.g. in Poetry:
  secure-scaffold = { git = ""https://github.com/google/gae-secure-scaffold-python3.git"", branch = ""master"" }
* Therefore, we were unable to use --require-hashes for any service using Secure Scaffold

Talking with David (an ATL) recently, he pointed out that pip will add hashes if you install from an archive e.g. in Poetry:
  secure-scaffold = {url = ""https://github.com/google/gae-secure-scaffold-python3/archive/refs/tags/1.1.0.zip""}

The downside to this is that poetry update won't update this dependency (where it will for Pypi based dependencies, assuming you specify they as e.g. &gt;=1.4.2) - but security feel the upside (of being able to use --require-hashes) is worth it.

FYI @John Carter as IIRC it was you who originally found that secure scaffold didn't work with --require-hashes

"give me 5 bullets of the most important things from this:

What keeps us healthy and happy
0:15
as we go through life?
0:18
If you were going to invest now
0:21
in your future best self,
0:23
where would you put your time and your energy?
0:27
There was a recent survey of millennials
0:29
asking them what their most important life goals were,
0:34
and over 80 percent said
0:36
that a major life goal for them was to get rich.
0:40
And another 50 percent of those same young adults
0:45
said that another major life goal
0:47
was to become famous.
0:50
(Laughter)
0:52
And we're constantly told to lean in to work, to push harder
0:58
and achieve more.
1:00
We're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after
1:04
in order to have a good life.
1:06
Pictures of entire lives,
1:08
of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them,
1:13
those pictures are almost impossible to get.
1:18
Most of what we know about human life
1:21
we know from asking people to remember the past,
1:24
and as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20.
1:29
We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life,
1:33
and sometimes memory is downright creative.
1:36
But what if we could watch entire lives
1:41
as they unfold through time?
1:44
What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers
1:48
all the way into old age
1:50
to see what really keeps people happy and healthy?
1:55
We did that.
1:57
The Harvard Study of Adult Development
1:59
may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done.
2:05
For 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men,
2:13
year after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health,
2:17
and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories
2:22
were going to turn out.
2:25
Studies like this are exceedingly rare.
2:28
Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade
2:33
because too many people drop out of the study,
2:36
or funding for the research dries up,
2:39
or the researchers get distracted,
2:41
or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field.
2:46
But through a combination of luck
2:48
and the persistence of several generations of researchers,
2:52
this study has survived.
2:54
About 60 of our original 724 men
2:59
are still alive,
3:00
still participating in the study,
3:02
most of them in their 90s.
3:05
And we are now beginning to study
3:07
the more than 2,000 children of these men.
3:11
And I'm the fourth director of the study.
3:15
Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men.
3:20
The first group started in the study
3:22
when they were sophomores at Harvard College.
3:25
They all finished college during World War II,
3:27
and then most went off to serve in the war.
3:31
And the second group that we've followed
3:33
was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods,
3:37
boys who were chosen for the study
3:39
specifically because they were from some of the most troubled
3:43
and disadvantaged families
3:44
in the Boston of the 1930s.
3:47
Most lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water.
3:54
When they entered the study,
3:56
all of these teenagers were interviewed.
3:59
They were given medical exams.
4:01
We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents.
4:05
And then these teenagers grew up into adults
4:07
who entered all walks of life.
4:10
They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors,
4:16
one President of the United States.
4:20
Some developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia.
4:25
Some climbed the social ladder
4:27
from the bottom all the way to the very top,
4:30
and some made that journey in the opposite direction.
4:35
The founders of this study
4:38
would never in their wildest dreams
4:40
have imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later,
4:45
telling you that the study still continues.
4:49
Every two years, our patient and dedicated research staff
4:52
calls up our men and asks them if we can send them
4:56
yet one more set of questions about their lives.
5:00
Many of the inner city Boston men ask us,
5:03
""Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting.""
5:08
The Harvard men never ask that question.
5:11
(Laughter)
5:20
To get the clearest picture of these lives,
5:23
we don't just send them questionnaires.
5:26
We interview them in their living rooms.
5:29
We get their medical records from their doctors.
5:32
We draw their blood, we scan their brains,
5:34
we talk to their children.
5:36
We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns.
5:41
And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives
5:45
if they would join us as members of the study,
5:47
many of the women said, ""You know, it's about time.""
5:50
(Laughter)
5:51
So what have we learned?
5:53
What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages
5:58
of information that we've generated
6:01
on these lives?
6:03
Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder.
6:10
The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this:
6:16
Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.
6:23
We've learned three big lessons about relationships.
6:26
The first is that social connections are really good for us,
6:30
and that loneliness kills.
6:33
It turns out that people who are more socially connected
6:37
to family, to friends, to community,
6:40
are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer
6:45
than people who are less well connected.
6:48
And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.
6:51
People who are more isolated than they want to be from others
6:57
find that they are less happy,
7:00
their health declines earlier in midlife,
7:03
their brain functioning declines sooner
7:05
and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely.
7:10
And the sad fact is that at any given time,
7:13
more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.
7:19
And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd
7:21
and you can be lonely in a marriage,
7:24
so the second big lesson that we learned
7:26
is that it's not just the number of friends you have,
7:29
and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship,
7:33
but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters.
7:38
It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health.
7:43
High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection,
7:47
turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.
7:53
And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.
7:57
Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s,
8:01
we wanted to look back at them at midlife
8:04
and to see if we could predict
8:05
who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian
8:09
and who wasn't.
8:11
And when we gathered together everything we knew about them
8:15
at age 50,
8:18
it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels
8:20
that predicted how they were going to grow old.
8:23
It was how satisfied they were in their relationships.
8:27
The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50
8:31
were the healthiest at age 80.
8:35
And good, close relationships seem to buffer us
8:38
from some of the slings and arrows of getting old.
8:42
Our most happily partnered men and women
8:46
reported, in their 80s,
8:48
that on the days when they had more physical pain,
8:51
their mood stayed just as happy.
8:54
But the people who were in unhappy relationships,
8:57
on the days when they reported more physical pain,
9:00
it was magnified by more emotional pain.
9:04
And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health
9:08
is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies,
9:12
they protect our brains.
9:14
It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship
9:19
to another person in your 80s is protective,
9:23
that the people who are in relationships
9:25
where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need,
9:29
those people's memories stay sharper longer.
9:32
And the people in relationships
9:34
where they feel they really can't count on the other one,
9:37
those are the people who experience earlier memory decline.
9:42
And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time.
9:46
Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other
9:49
day in and day out,
9:51
but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other
9:54
when the going got tough,
9:56
those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.
10:01
So this message,
10:04
that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being,
10:10
this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.
10:13
Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore?
10:17
Well, we're human.
10:19
What we'd really like is a quick fix,
10:21
something we can get
10:23
that'll make our lives good and keep them that way.
10:27
Relationships are messy and they're complicated
10:30
and the hard work of tending to family and friends,
10:34
it's not sexy or glamorous.
10:37
It's also lifelong. It never ends.
10:40
The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement
10:45
were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates.
10:51
Just like the millennials in that recent survey,
10:54
many of our men when they were starting out as young adults
10:58
really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement
11:02
were what they needed to go after to have a good life.
11:06
But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown
11:10
that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships,
11:16
with family, with friends, with community.
11:21
So what about you?
11:23
Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60.
11:27
What might leaning in to relationships even look like?
11:31
Well, the possibilities are practically endless.
11:35
It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time
11:41
or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,
11:46
long walks or date nights,
11:49
or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years,
11:54
because those all-too-common family feuds
11:57
take a terrible toll
12:00
on the people who hold the grudges.
12:04
I'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain.
12:09
More than a century ago,
12:11
he was looking back on his life,
12:14
and he wrote this:
12:16
""There isn't time, so brief is life,
12:20
for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account.
12:26
There is only time for loving,
12:29
and but an instant, so to speak, for that.""
12:34
The good life is built with good relationships.
12:39
Thank you.","What keeps us healthy and happy
0:15
as we go through life?
0:18
If you were going to invest now
0:21
in your future best self,
0:23
where would you put your time and your energy?
0:27
There was a recent survey of millennials
0:29
asking them what their most important life goals were,
0:34
and over 80 percent said
0:36
that a major life goal for them was to get rich.
0:40
And another 50 percent of those same young adults
0:45
said that another major life goal
0:47
was to become famous.
0:50
(Laughter)
0:52
And we're constantly told to lean in to work, to push harder
0:58
and achieve more.
1:00
We're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after
1:04
in order to have a good life.
1:06
Pictures of entire lives,
1:08
of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them,
1:13
those pictures are almost impossible to get.
1:18
Most of what we know about human life
1:21
we know from asking people to remember the past,
1:24
and as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20.
1:29
We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life,
1:33
and sometimes memory is downright creative.
1:36
But what if we could watch entire lives
1:41
as they unfold through time?
1:44
What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers
1:48
all the way into old age
1:50
to see what really keeps people happy and healthy?
1:55
We did that.
1:57
The Harvard Study of Adult Development
1:59
may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done.
2:05
For 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men,
2:13
year after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health,
2:17
and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories
2:22
were going to turn out.
2:25
Studies like this are exceedingly rare.
2:28
Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade
2:33
because too many people drop out of the study,
2:36
or funding for the research dries up,
2:39
or the researchers get distracted,
2:41
or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field.
2:46
But through a combination of luck
2:48
and the persistence of several generations of researchers,
2:52
this study has survived.
2:54
About 60 of our original 724 men
2:59
are still alive,
3:00
still participating in the study,
3:02
most of them in their 90s.
3:05
And we are now beginning to study
3:07
the more than 2,000 children of these men.
3:11
And I'm the fourth director of the study.
3:15
Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men.
3:20
The first group started in the study
3:22
when they were sophomores at Harvard College.
3:25
They all finished college during World War II,
3:27
and then most went off to serve in the war.
3:31
And the second group that we've followed
3:33
was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods,
3:37
boys who were chosen for the study
3:39
specifically because they were from some of the most troubled
3:43
and disadvantaged families
3:44
in the Boston of the 1930s.
3:47
Most lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water.
3:54
When they entered the study,
3:56
all of these teenagers were interviewed.
3:59
They were given medical exams.
4:01
We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents.
4:05
And then these teenagers grew up into adults
4:07
who entered all walks of life.
4:10
They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors,
4:16
one President of the United States.
4:20
Some developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia.
4:25
Some climbed the social ladder
4:27
from the bottom all the way to the very top,
4:30
and some made that journey in the opposite direction.
4:35
The founders of this study
4:38
would never in their wildest dreams
4:40
have imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later,
4:45
telling you that the study still continues.
4:49
Every two years, our patient and dedicated research staff
4:52
calls up our men and asks them if we can send them
4:56
yet one more set of questions about their lives.
5:00
Many of the inner city Boston men ask us,
5:03
""Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting.""
5:08
The Harvard men never ask that question.
5:11
(Laughter)
5:20
To get the clearest picture of these lives,
5:23
we don't just send them questionnaires.
5:26
We interview them in their living rooms.
5:29
We get their medical records from their doctors.
5:32
We draw their blood, we scan their brains,
5:34
we talk to their children.
5:36
We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns.
5:41
And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives
5:45
if they would join us as members of the study,
5:47
many of the women said, ""You know, it's about time.""
5:50
(Laughter)
5:51
So what have we learned?
5:53
What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages
5:58
of information that we've generated
6:01
on these lives?
6:03
Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder.
6:10
The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this:
6:16
Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.
6:23
We've learned three big lessons about relationships.
6:26
The first is that social connections are really good for us,
6:30
and that loneliness kills.
6:33
It turns out that people who are more socially connected
6:37
to family, to friends, to community,
6:40
are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer
6:45
than people who are less well connected.
6:48
And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.
6:51
People who are more isolated than they want to be from others
6:57
find that they are less happy,
7:00
their health declines earlier in midlife,
7:03
their brain functioning declines sooner
7:05
and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely.
7:10
And the sad fact is that at any given time,
7:13
more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.
7:19
And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd
7:21
and you can be lonely in a marriage,
7:24
so the second big lesson that we learned
7:26
is that it's not just the number of friends you have,
7:29
and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship,
7:33
but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters.
7:38
It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health.
7:43
High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection,
7:47
turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.
7:53
And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.
7:57
Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s,
8:01
we wanted to look back at them at midlife
8:04
and to see if we could predict
8:05
who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian
8:09
and who wasn't.
8:11
And when we gathered together everything we knew about them
8:15
at age 50,
8:18
it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels
8:20
that predicted how they were going to grow old.
8:23
It was how satisfied they were in their relationships.
8:27
The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50
8:31
were the healthiest at age 80.
8:35
And good, close relationships seem to buffer us
8:38
from some of the slings and arrows of getting old.
8:42
Our most happily partnered men and women
8:46
reported, in their 80s,
8:48
that on the days when they had more physical pain,
8:51
their mood stayed just as happy.
8:54
But the people who were in unhappy relationships,
8:57
on the days when they reported more physical pain,
9:00
it was magnified by more emotional pain.
9:04
And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health
9:08
is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies,
9:12
they protect our brains.
9:14
It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship
9:19
to another person in your 80s is protective,
9:23
that the people who are in relationships
9:25
where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need,
9:29
those people's memories stay sharper longer.
9:32
And the people in relationships
9:34
where they feel they really can't count on the other one,
9:37
those are the people who experience earlier memory decline.
9:42
And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time.
9:46
Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other
9:49
day in and day out,
9:51
but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other
9:54
when the going got tough,
9:56
those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.
10:01
So this message,
10:04
that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being,
10:10
this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.
10:13
Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore?
10:17
Well, we're human.
10:19
What we'd really like is a quick fix,
10:21
something we can get
10:23
that'll make our lives good and keep them that way.
10:27
Relationships are messy and they're complicated
10:30
and the hard work of tending to family and friends,
10:34
it's not sexy or glamorous.
10:37
It's also lifelong. It never ends.
10:40
The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement
10:45
were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates.
10:51
Just like the millennials in that recent survey,
10:54
many of our men when they were starting out as young adults
10:58
really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement
11:02
were what they needed to go after to have a good life.
11:06
But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown
11:10
that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships,
11:16
with family, with friends, with community.
11:21
So what about you?
11:23
Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60.
11:27
What might leaning in to relationships even look like?
11:31
Well, the possibilities are practically endless.
11:35
It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time
11:41
or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,
11:46
long walks or date nights,
11:49
or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years,
11:54
because those all-too-common family feuds
11:57
take a terrible toll
12:00
on the people who hold the grudges.
12:04

"Can you write a Java program to solve this Problem Statement (called ""NoOrderOfOperations"") ?

Problem Statement

When evaluating a mathematical expression, there is the possibility of ambiguity. If you wanted to know the result of ""3 + 5 * 7"", you might first evaluate the (3+5) and get 56, or first evaluate the (5*7) and get 38. This ambiguity can be resolved by using the order of operations: first do multiplication and division (from left to right), and then after all those are done, do addition and subtraction (again from left to right). Here, the correct result would be the 38.
While this is unambiguous, it certainly is somewhat annoying. You think it would be easier if people did all math from left to right, all the time, and want to make a simple expression evaluator to do so.
The expression will be given to you as a String expr. It will consist of one digit numbers (0 through 9) alternating with operators (+, -, or *), with no spaces between them. Thus, expr would follow the format Digit Operator Digit Operator .... Digit. For example, the expression given above would be given as ""3+5*7"".
Your method should return an int representing the value of the expression when evaluated from left to right.

The Method signature should be	""int evaluate(String expr)""
	
Constraints:
-	expr will be between 1 and 17 characters in length, inclusive.
-	expr will contain an odd number of characters.
-	expr will follow the format Digit Operator Digit Operator ... Digit, where each Digit is a single character from '0' to '9', and each Operator is either +, -, or *.

Examples
0)	""3+5*7""	

Returns: 56
First we add 3 + 5 to get 8. Then, we multiply 8 by 7 to get 56.	

1)	 ""4-8*9*1""

 Notice to Owner 
Under the California Mechanics Lien Law any contractor, subcontractor, laborer, supplies or other persona  who helps to improve your property but is not paid for his/her work or supplies, has a right to enforce a claim  against your property. This means that after a court hearing, your property could be sold by a court officer  and the proceeds of the sale used to satisfy the indebtedness. This can happen even if you have paid your  contractor in full the subcontractors, laborers, or suppliers remain unpaid.  
To preserve their right to file a claim or lien against your property, certain claimants such as subcontractors or  materials suppliers are required to provide you with a document entitled “Preliminary Notice.” Original (or  prime) contractors and laborers for wages do not have to provide this notice. A Preliminary Notice is not a  lien against your property if they are not paid. (Generally, the maximum time allowed for filing a claim or lien  against your property is ninety (90) days after completion of your project.)

"In 3-5 sentences, how would describe the intention of the LinkedIn post below? A good way to get to know how ChatGPT works is by testing it on yourself. We know ourselves best.

In my first encounter with ChatGPT, I had it look at my LinkedIn profile. It *insisted* I was passionate about the environment. While I do my part, it's not a topic I cover. I've never had anything like that in my profile.

And get this. ChatGPT had nary a mention of accessibility and disabilities. I did my darndest to train the AI on this.

Anyway, I started a fresh conversation by asking it to tell me about Meryl Evans of Plano. I fed it my website link and LinkedIn profile. This way, it knows which Meryl Evans it's analyzing. Yup, there are a few Meryl Evanses out there.

The response was general as most of its content is. I tried to give ChatGPT permission to look at what's available publicly. Right away, it shared wrong information. It claimed I spoke at several conferences that I have never attended. Wrong-o, bub.

Error No. 2. It claimed I authored a book that's not familiar. It also claimed I've contributed to Entrepreneur, Copyblogger, and TechCrunch. Nope. I have not. Yikes!

Out of curiosity, I asked for details on these. ChatGPT provided titles. I asked where it got the idea I've written for TechCrunch. It apologized for the mistake and could not confirm I've contributed to it. Then, I asked where the Copyblogger articles are located. It provided a link for my supposed author page. The link does not exist. Holy cow! It's making up links!

I countered that I haven't written for Copyblogger and the link does not exist. It apologized again. Next, ""show me Meryl's articles on Entrepreneur."" It provided four titles and five links including one for an author's page. None of them exist!

ChatGPT claimed I could find a list of Enterpreneur articles in the featured section of my LinkedIn profile. I've never listed one there. It continued to provide more fictional details about my writing.

Seriously? I have a list of past articles on my website. Do a search for ""Meryl Evans articles"" and plenty pop up.

ChatGPT makes up stuff including articles I supposedly wrote, presentations I supposedly gave, and links. Wow.

It could not answer simple questions where the answer is readily available. It goes without saying to always check out ChatGPT's data. Go to the primary resource. It often provides the name of a resource. That should make it easier to confirm whether it exists and it's accurate.

I'm grateful to learn this lesson early.

Yes, you can have it write an article or a paper. But so far, its content is loaded with empty calories. The future is AI and humans working together, not AI replacing humans. AI will take over the tedious stuff while leaving us to do value-added work.

Your task is to create a Python script using the `scikit-fuzzy` library to implement a fuzzy inference system (FIS) based on the following ruleset, simulating potential issues in a refrigeration system. Generate only the executable Python code, adhering to the specified requirements:

1.  **Core Library:** Utilize the `scikit-fuzzy` library for fuzzy logic operations. Ensure the code is compatible with recent versions of this library.
2.  **Ruleset Implementation:** Define the fuzzy rules exactly as provided below, ensuring correct syntax and logical interpretation within the `scikit-fuzzy` framework.

    **Fuzzy Rules:**
    *   **Rule 1:** IF (showcase_temp1_f5 IS High) AND (showcase_temp1_f7 IS High) AND (showcase_temp1_f9 IS High) AND (condensing_pressure IS Low) AND (evaporation_pressure IS High) AND (Time is Long) THEN Issue IS RefrigerantLeakage.
    *   **Rule 2:** IF (showcase_temp1_f5 IS MediumHigh) OR (showcase_temp1_f7 IS MediumHigh) OR (showcase_temp1_f9 IS MediumHigh) AND (return_gas_temp IS Low) THEN Issue IS EvaporationFrostProblem.

3.  **Membership Functions:** Design intuitive, representative membership functions (MFs) for each of the following fuzzy variables:
    *   `showcase_temp1_f5`, `showcase_temp1_f7`, `showcase_temp1_f9`, `return_gas_temp`, `condensing_pressure`, `evaporation_pressure`, and `Time`.

    Define meaningful fuzzy sets (e.g., 'Low', 'Medium', 'High'; 'Low', 'High'; 'Long', 'VeryLong') for each variable, and use appropriate MFs (e.g., triangular, trapezoidal). Ensure the MFs cover the range of reasonable sensor readings for these parameters in a refrigeration context and that adjacent fuzzy sets overlap appropriately to model uncertainty.
4.  **Output Variable:** Define the output fuzzy variable as `Issue` and its fuzzy sets as `RefrigerantLeakage`, `EvaporationFrostProblem`, `CondenserNotClean`, and `ExpansionValveLeakage`. Provide appropriate MFs for these output sets, representing the levels of confidence in each detected issue.
5.  **Code Structure:** Your script must include:
    *   Import statements for `scikit-fuzzy` and necessary utilities.
    *   Definition of input fuzzy variables and their corresponding membership functions and fuzzy sets.
    *   Definition of the output fuzzy variable, sets, and MFs.
    *   Definition and assignment of the fuzzy rules using the variables, sets, and operators.
    *   Demonstration code using `skfuzzy.control` to create a `ControlSystem`, a `ControlSystemSimulation` object, and simulate the fuzzy system using example inputs (e.g., inputs reflecting the conditions in each rule).
    *   Code to visualize the defined input and output MFs using `matplotlib`.
6.  **Code Quality & Comments:** Write clear, well-commented Python code. Include inline comments explaining the purpose and functionality of key code sections, variable assignments, and the logic behind the rules.
7.  **Output:** Ensure the script prints the crisp output values for the `Issue` variable based on the example inputs provided. Also, the visualization of the membership functions must display clearly.

1.  **Excel Input Handling:** The program must correctly read an Excel file (`.xlsx`) provided by the user via command-line argument (e.g., `python yt_downloader.py input_links.xlsx`).
    *   **Structure:** Expect the Excel file to have a standard two-column structure:
        *   **Column 1 (e.g., ""Filename""):** Contains the desired filename (e.g., ""MyVideo_2024.mp4"").
        *   **Column 2 (e.g., ""YouTube Link""):** Contains the YouTube video URL (e.g., ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEOID"").

2.  **YouTube Video Retrieval:**
    *   Employ the `pytube` library to obtain the 720p stream (or highest available if 720p is unavailable) for each YouTube link provided in the Excel file.
    *   **Link Validation:** Implement robust validation to check if each URL retrieved from the Excel file is a valid, shareable YouTube link (e.g., uses `watch?v=` or starts with `youtube.com/` or `youtu.be/`). Skip invalid links with informative error messages.
    *   **Download Location:** Prompt the user for a destination folder path via the command line where downloaded files will be saved.
    *   **Output Folder Structure:** If not provided, default the output location to a 'Downloads' folder relative to the script's current working directory. Ensure this directory exists or attempt to create it.

3.  **Concurrent Downloading Strategy (Batch Processing):**
    *   Implement a mechanism (e.g., using `threading`, `multiprocessing`, or an asynchronous framework like `asyncio`) to download exactly 10 YouTube videos concurrently.
    *   Organize the Excel rows into batches of 10 (the final batch may contain fewer rows if the Excel has fewer than 10 videos left).
    *   For each batch, initiate the 10 downloads simultaneously.
    *   After the 10 downloads in a batch have completed (either successfully, with errors handled, or skipped due to validation), proceed to download the next batch of 10.

4.  **Filename Handling:**
    *   If the destination file already exists with the intended filename, append a sequential number (e.g., `(1)`, `(2)`) to the filename before the extension (e.g., ""MyVideo_2024(1).mp4"").
    *   Handle common issues like invalid characters for filenames or file-system-specific limitations (e.g., maximum path length). Replace or sanitize these characters in the user-provided filename.

5.  **Error Handling:** Implement specific error handling for:
    *   Invalid YouTube URLs.
    *   URLs that are private or no longer valid.
    *   Stream not available.
    *   Download failures due to network issues or library limitations.
    *   File writing errors (e.g., permission issues).

"I'm trying to find a reliable way to proxy occasional HTTP access to any of  ~100 geographically dispersed IOT devices through a cloud server.  

I'm using Go on the cloud server and on the IOT devices, so I thought I'd ask here.

Situation:

We have complete control over the configuration of the IOT devices and the cloud host.
We don't have control of the customers' routers and firewalls, but can specify minimum requirements for port openings, etc.
FWIW, the IOT devices are BeagleBone Black running Debian Buster and the cloud host will be, typically, a multi-core droplet (or similar) running Linux.
The IOT's serve dynamic web pages over HTTP. (HTTPS doesn't seem feasible because of certificate requirements and overall load on the IOT cpu.) The cloud host will have HTTPS capability.
This is a low-traffic situation. The IOT's report some overall status information (via rsync/ssh) at 4 minute intervals). We already have a web interface (written in Go) on the cloud server that aggregates and displays the status reports.
Access to an IOT's web service will only occur when a user wants to investigate a problem report in more detail. Typically, only one or two users will have credentials to browse the cloud server.
The scheme I have in mind is: 
At configuration time for each IOT device the installation tech will use ssh-copy-id to install the IOT device's public key on the cloud service.
The IOT device will  then remotely execute a one-shot program (already written and tested) on the cloud server.  The IOT will provide a unique identifier as an argument and the program will return a permanent port number and add a record to a database to record the assignment.
The IOT will open a reverse SSH tunnel on the server (probably managed by auto-ssh) specifying the permanent port on the server and a local port on which it will listen for HTTP requests.
The cloud server, when generating status report pages, will include a link to fetch the home page of each IOT device by embedding its unique identifier specified in step 2 above.
The piece I'm missing is how to construct a proxying handler that will use the identifier in the link to look up the tunnel port and fetch the IOT's home page and thereafter make it seem as though the user is directly browsing the IOT.

I'm using Go on the cloud server and on the IOT devices, so I thought I'd ask here.",True,97739,"Design a Go web server handler function for a cloud service that proxies HTTP traffic to an IoT device based on a unique identifier embedded in incoming requests (e.g., in a URL parameter).

**Context:**
1.  The cloud server is running a Go web service handling infrequent user access to IoT device web interfaces.
2.  Each IoT device initiates and maintains a reverse SSH tunnel (using `auto-ssh`) back to the cloud server, listening for incoming HTTP requests on its configured local port.
3.  The cloud server web handler receives requests including a unique IoT device identifier (e.g., `https://cloud-server.example.com/iot/<iot-device-identifier>`).
4.  The server stores a mapping of IoT device identifiers to corresponding SSH tunnel ports.

**Objective:**
The Go handler must:
1.  Extract the IoT device identifier from the request path.
2.  Look up the associated SSH tunnel port on the cloud server for that identifier (e.g., from a database).
3.  Establish an `ssh.Conn` using the tunnel details retrieved from the identifier-to-port mapping.
4.  Forward the client's HTTP request via this `ssh.Conn` to the IoT device's local HTTP port (through the SSH tunnel).
5.  Stream the HTTP response body back to the client from the IoT device.
6.  Handle SSH connection setup, closing, and error propagation gracefully.

**Considerations/Assumptions:**
*   The HTTP request is routed to this handler by the cloud server's router.
*   The handler function will likely operate within the context of a standard Go `http.ServeMux`.
*   The core SSH tunnel setup and port mapping mechanism is already implemented and assumed working.
*   Error handling should be robust, specifically addressing issues like invalid identifiers, missing port mappings, SSH connection failures, and HTTP proxying errors.
*   The reverse SSH tunnels are assumed persistent (managed by `auto-ssh`) and established before user requests arrive.
*   Focus on clarity and reliability of the Go implementation."

App Router compatible: 
Full static export when using the `app` directory.

All routes are opted in to `export const dynamic = 'error'` giving you early errors for e.g. calling `headers()` / `cookies()` as there is no server.

Server Component could already be rendered as static html for initial load and static payload for client navigation. There are no additional changes to make it work for output: export.

https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/static-and-dynamic-rendering#static-rendering-default

---

Route Handlers compatible:
Route handlers (route.js / route.ts) can be rendered to a static response at build time if you it only exports GET and doesn't read values from `request`.

Route handlers that use static rendering are supported in output: export.

---

Built-in to `next build`:
You no longer have to run `next export`. The output of `next build` will have the `out` directory.

`next export` has mostly been a copying operation, it copies the result from next build static rendering to the `out` directory. Now it's fully built-in.


---

Ensures development matches static export:
Since Next.js allows you to use both static and dynamic rendering next export had to warn/error when you used features that need a server, this led to finding out the application couldn't export later on.

output: export bridges this gap in functionality by giving you feedback during development that a certain feature can't be used when you want to build an application without dynamic rendering.

3.  **`copyfromhub` Execution:** Call the command `copyfromhub [file_name]` using the generated file name within the loop for each integer.
4.  **Error Handling:** Include a check within the loop to confirm that the `copyfromhub` command executed successfully (use `$?` for exit status 0). If the command fails for a specific file (exit status other than 0), print an informative error message indicating which file download failed.
5.  **File Checking:** Before attempting the download, verify the existence of the file `hub_file_pulses_INTEGER` locally using `[ -f ""[local_file_path]/hub_file_pulses_INTEGER"" ]`. If the local file exists, skip the download and optionally print a message stating it's skipped. Replace `[local_file_path]` with the appropriate local directory path (e.g., the current working directory `./`).
6.  **Commenting:** Include clear comments within the script explaining the purpose of each section, important commands (like `copyfromhub`, `find`, `if`), and the logic.

**Script Output:**
The script will generate output showing:
-   The file name it attempts to copy via `copyfromhub`.
-   Whether the command succeeded or failed, indicating potential download errors.
-   Messages if a local version of the file already exists (skipped download)."

    *   The fundamental processes of cloud formation (e.g., condensation, precipitation mechanisms, the role of water vapor and temperature).
4.  **Knowledge-Based:** Focus on identifying *what* something is, *how* it forms, or its *key characteristics*. Avoid questions that require complex calculations or interpretations beyond basic principles.

Provide the three questions in the following format:

**Question #:**
**[Choose the best answer]:**

create a trading bot,,create a trading bot,False,32019,"Provide a detailed Python code example for a simple trading bot that executes the following strategy:

1.  **Data Input:** Simulate receiving historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for a specific cryptocurrency and timeframe (e.g., daily BTC/USD).
2.  **Indicator Calculation:** Compute a 10-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) using the 'Close' prices of the simulated data.
3.  **Trading Rules:**
    *   **Long:** Enter a long position (buy) if the current close price crosses *above* the 10-period SMA.
    *   **Short:** Enter a short position (sell) if the current close price crosses *below* the 10-period SMA.
    *   **TP/SL:** Set a take-profit level 5% above the entry price and a stop-loss level 2% below the entry price for each trade.
4.  **Position Management:** Include logic to check if take-profit or stop-loss levels are triggered for open trades and close positions accordingly. Implement a simple account management simulation to track entry/exit prices, profits/losses, and simulated account balance.
5.  **Output:** For each day's simulated data point, output the following:
    *   Timestamp
    *   Open price
    *   High price
    *   Low price
    *   Close price
    *   Calculated 10-period SMA
    *   Trading action (e.g., 'LONG', 'SHORT', 'TAKE PROFIT - LONG', 'STOP LOSS - SHORT', 'NONE')"

};",Can you write a jest test for the following code using @testing-library/react,True,93987,"Generate a comprehensive set of unit tests for the React component `Timeline` and its child `ListItem` using Jest and the `@testing-library/react` testing library.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Structure:** Organize the tests into two distinct `describe` blocks: one for `Timeline` and one for `ListItem`.
2.  **`Timeline` Tests:**
    *   **Test 1:** Render the `Timeline` component. Assert that the root `div` is rendered.
    *   **Test 2:** Render `Timeline` with the `future` prop populated. Verify that the `future` section container (with class `rounded-t border border-dashed border-stone-300 p-4`) is rendered.
    *   **Test 3:** Render `Timeline` with the `timeline` prop populated. Verify that the `timeline` section container (with class `border-stone-300 p-4`) is rendered.
    *   **Test 4:** Render `Timeline` with both `future` and `timeline` props populated. Ensure that *both* sections are rendered, and confirm the correct CSS class combination (e.g., `rounded-t border border-dashed border-stone-300 p-4 rounded-b border-l border-r border-b border-stone-300 p-4`).
    *   **Test 5:** Ensure that the `<ListItem>` component is correctly rendered once per item passed within both the `future` and `timeline` props. Verify correct props are passed to each rendered `<ListItem>` based on the original data passed.
3.  **`ListItem` Tests:**
    *   **Test 1:** Render `ListItem` with all required props. Assert that the root `li` element, the icon container, and the text container (with `font-medium mb-1` paragraph) are rendered.
    *   **Test 2:** Verify that the icon's size and weight are correctly applied using `cloneElement`.
    *   **Test 3:** Confirm that the correct background color is applied to the icon container, prioritizing `event.iconBackgroundColor` over `defaultIconBackgroundColor`.
    *   **Test 4:** Verify that the icon container's border is rendered or hidden correctly based on the `iconBorder` prop (using `border-stone-300` class).
    *   **Test 5:** If the `event.subText` prop is provided, assert that the sub-text paragraph (class `text-zinc-500 text-sm`) is correctly rendered below the main text paragraph.
4.  **Matchers:** Utilize appropriate `@testing-library/react` matchers such as `screen.getByRole`, `screen.getByText`, `screen.getByTestId`, and/or `screen.getByClassName` (or `screen.queryBy*`) effectively for element selection and assertions.
5.  **Imports:** Ensure necessary imports for React, Jest, and `@testing-library/react` (including `render` and `screen`).

Output the complete, runnable Jest test file containing the generated tests."
