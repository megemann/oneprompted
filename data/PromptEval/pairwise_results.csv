On GigSalad, we deliver more than 600 categories of entertainment and event services for the ability to compare rates of various performers. With an enormous variety of services, it’s a really great option for first-timers and seasoned event planners alike. But with so many talented professionals out there, how do you choose? Budget may be a large factor in who you choose to book, but before you make your choice, here are 6 reasons for choosing the best entertainment, not the cheapest.

1. You get what you pay for.
Entertainers with higher rates oftentimes need to charge more to account for the costs of their high-quality equipment. Many performers set them based on their professional experience. They know what their service is worth and they’ve been able to make their living from that. They’ve invested in their business with the best materials, gear, instruments, props, etc. to give their clients most immersive experience. These materials can make a huge difference between one vendor and another.

Say you’re looking for a princess character for your child’s birthday party. To make a fairy tale come to life, performers need costumes and accessories that not only look pretty and authentic but also hold up to wear and tear. Along with the costs of dry cleaning, well-made costumes are a large investment for professional princess characters. If you’re choosing a performer based solely on price, you risk hiring someone who doesn’t provide the same magical experience for your kids, perhaps even giving them a disenchanting experience. A top-notch entertainer will deliver a performance that you and your family will remember for years to come.

 


 

Don’t let the sticker shock of good entertainment throw off your plans. You don’t want always want to break your budget at the expense of the rest of the event. Simply determine your priorities and set the spending from there. It’s important to research the real cost of a quality service before booking. If there is a significant drop-off between bids, then you can probably expect a drop-off in quality as well. Adjust your budget to your talent and quality expectations.

2. Professionals who are invested in their business are also invested in their clients.
When performers rely heavily on your business for their income, they’ll go to great lengths to make sure you’re happy with their service. Most of our GigSalad entertainers are self-employed, independent business people. They depend on good reviews and word of mouth for promotion and buzz.

Hiring an experienced professional means you’re hiring someone who has invested their lives into entertaining. Their goal is to make a living and provide you with a memorable event at the same time. Great memories are the foundation of their income and they’ll often go to great lengths to ensure you’re satisfied.

3. Pros know how to customize for your needs.
Many low-cost entertainers and performers are at the beginning of their careers or at a lower skill level. Often, this means that they offer a limited repertoire and fewer options as they are developing their craft. Your event is unique to you, therefore, you’ll need someone who can customize their act or services to your event. A good sign of a professional is their ability and willingness to reasonably adapt to your event needs.

4. Pros offer more than just entertainment. They give you peace of mind.
Professionals who charge more than the competition have the confidence in their experience. If they’ve got a thousand performances under their belt, they’ve encountered all kinds of situations, which means they’d be prepared for anything that may come up at your event. The ability to adapt and improvise is especially beneficial in unexpected situations that put your event at risk of turning into a disaster!


5. The difference in cost makes all the difference in the success of your event.
You’ve decided to take the risk and hire an entertainer for your event. Perhaps a strolling magician for the office party you were picked to plan. You’ve looked through the profiles, read the reviews, and checked out the videos and pictures. When the moment of decision comes, the temptation of saving a few bucks by hiring someone with fewer reviews and a lower quality presentation get very real very quickly. That’s money that could go to streamers! But those few dollars could mean the difference in the quality of your event and the likelihood of using entertainment again. A great professional turns the groans of “Remember last year? I hope that doesn’t happen again,” to the excitement of “Remember last year? I can’t wait to see what happens this time!” Paying a few extra bucks can prevent the dreaded buyer’s remorse.

6. There are no do-overs.
GigSalad’s mission is to help you Book Something Awesome. We recognize that many of the events we connect entertainers with are often once in a lifetime moments. That significance is one of the reasons we encourage you to take the time and research your providers well. You may not get a chance to do it again. We hope that you would take the few extra minutes necessary to thoroughly read the bids, examine the profiles, view the media, and make an educated decision. Don’t risk devaluing a critical life moment or celebration by going bargain hunting. If the price is right and the quality is high, invest in the memory.  

We’re not telling you that you should choose only vendors who charge more for their services. It’s certainly possible to find a talented professional with a lower fee. We’re simply encouraging you to do your homework. Look at their photos and videos, read reviews, ask them questions. Figure out why their rates are what they are. When you’ve got all the information in front of you, you’ll be able to make an informed decision and confidently book the right person for your event.",resp_none,resp_v1,A

*   **MORE ROBUST VALIDATION:** RESPONSE A INCLUDES EMAIL VALIDATION USING THE `VALIDATOR` LIBRARY AND DURATION VALIDATION. THIS IS CRUCIAL FOR DATA INTEGRITY. RESPONSE B ONLY CHECKS FOR THE PRESENCE OF AN EMAIL BUT DOESN'T VALIDATE ITS FORMAT.
*   **CLEARER ERROR REPORTING:** RESPONSE A PROVIDES DETAILED REASONS FOR SKIPPING RECORDS, WHICH IS HELPFUL FOR DEBUGGING. RESPONSE B ONLY LOGS A GENERIC ERROR MESSAGE.
*   **CORRECT DURATION CONVERSION:** RESPONSE A CORRECTLY CONVERTS THE DURATION FROM DAYS TO SECONDS BEFORE INSERTING IT INTO THE DATABASE, WHICH MIGHT BE A REQUIREMENT DEPENDING ON HOW THE DURATION IS INTENDED TO BE USED. RESPONSE B DOESN'T HANDLE THE DURATION AT ALL.
*   **COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENT HANDLING:** RESPONSE A USES COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS TO SPECIFY THE CSV FILE PATH, WHICH IS MORE FLEXIBLE THAN HARDCODING IT IN THE `.ENV` FILE (AS IN RESPONSE B). THIS MAKES THE SCRIPT MORE REUSABLE.
*   **MODERN JAVASCRIPT SYNTAX:** RESPONSE A USES ES MODULES (`IMPORT` AND `EXPORT`), WHICH IS THE PREFERRED WAY OF WRITING JAVASCRIPT CODE THESE DAYS. RESPONSE B USES `REQUIRE`, WHICH IS OLDER SYNTAX. THE ""TYPE"": ""MODULE"" IN THE `PACKAGE.JSON` MAKES THIS VIABLE.
*   **PROPERLY CLOSES CONNECTION:** RESPONSE A INCLUDES A CHECK TO SEE IF THE CLIENT IS INITIALIZED BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO CLOSE THE CONNECTION, ENSURING THAT IT ONLY ATTEMPTS TO CLOSE IF THE CONNECTION WAS SUCCESSFULLY ESTABLISHED.
*   **MORE COMPREHENSIVE EXPLANATION:** THE EXPLANATION ACCOMPANYING RESPONSE A IS MORE DETAILED AND PROVIDES BETTER GUIDANCE ON HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPT, INCLUDING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETTING UP THE `.ENV` FILE, CREATING THE CSV FILE, AND INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES.

RESPONSE B HAS SOME WEAKNESSES:

*   **ASSUMES FIRST COLUMN IS EMAIL:** IT ASSUMES THE EMAIL IS ALWAYS IN THE FIRST COLUMN OF THE CSV, WHICH IS NOT FLEXIBLE. WHILE IT ATTEMPTS TO RETRIEVE THE FIRST KEY IT IS LESS EXPLICIT.
*   **TIMEOUT FOR CLOSING CONNECTION:** RESPONSE B USES A `SETTIMEOUT` TO CLOSE THE MONGODB CONNECTION, WHICH IS UNRELIABLE. THE `SETTIMEOUT` IS A WORKAROUND FOR NOT PROPERLY AWAITING THE COMPLETION OF ASYNCHRONOUS TASKS.
*   **LACKS DATA VALIDATION:** RESPONSE B DOESN'T VALIDATE THE EMAIL FORMAT OR THE DURATION, WHICH CAN LEAD TO INVALID DATA BEING INSERTED INTO THE DATABASE.

FOR THESE REASONS, RESPONSE A IS THE SUPERIOR CHOICE."

"Please summarize the following email thread:
Dear Elisabeth,

Thank you. I'm looking through the requirements and the application. It says it takes ""at least"" two weeks - do you have any idea if it will be 2 weeks or longer? 
According to the Consult Gerneral in US, it said nornmally it will only take 4 work days. Although this is a very old post but I looked through the website and did not see they post any new annoucement about the processing time, so I think this annoucement is still valid. However, I think Chinese Embassy are a bit strict these days so may take more time to get a visa than usual. (Adeh took 2-3 monthes to apply for a reunion visa for his son Yaoyao last year which is super annoying)


For me, which is better? To use my US passport or my Dutch passport?
The only doable visa for both of you are Business visa, so please do business visa for yourself too. I think it does not matter which passport you use.

Dear ELisabeth,

According to China Consulate Gerneral in NewYork, at the current stage, multi-year multiple-entry visas issued before March 26, 2020 are still suspended of use. 
So both you and Ulrich will need to apply for a new business visa. (so far the easiest one)
Here is the lastest China visa application instructions: http://newyork.china-consulate.gov.cn/eng/tzgg/202301/t20230109_11004155.htm
According the link above, kudelabs will need to offer you two invitation letters for business visa. We wll make them next Monday and send them back to you.

Have a nice day!

Thank you!

Xurry and I just talked, the trouble we have to receive money from you is all because of Panama. So the easiest way to do is you transfer USD to Adeh's US bank account, then Adeh using his US bank account to transfer money to my China Bank account. Xurry is using David's paypal, so maybe it would be best if we don't need to involve David in.

Dear Adeh and Ulrich, could you please see if this work fine with you guys?



I ended up being able to cancel the $4000 recurring transfer, and don’t see any evidence that any $4000 transfers actually went out. 

CATHY: OK, Thanks for checking, I just wanna mask sure the $4000 is trackable.

Did you hear anything from the recipient bank about this having been returned? 
I’m 90% sure it was never sent. 


Meanwhile, apparently the $6000 transfers was returned, and the $5980 one was not returned so you should have received that. 

CATHY: Correct, we have received the $5980 payment, and this is the only one payment we received so far.

Ok, great. 


I that consistent with what you know? Any money in limbo still? 

CATHY: Yes. The balance is around 20,000RMB now, but we will need at least 10,000RMB more to cover the expense this month. 

And, how do I send more now? 

CATHY: Can we try paypal? @Xurry

Oh! That’s probably easiest. @xurry would that work? To which address should I send it? 



Thanks for your patience. What a mess!

Please check and see if the payment is automatically refund to your HSBC account, and we will need to figure out the way to transfer money to Kude before the end of this month.

So far, we only receivd the first 6000USD to your CMB account, the third payment to Xurry is refunded, please also check if it has arrived or not.

Dear Boss,

We have received the first ppayment, which is 5980usd to your CMB account yesterday, so we should be OK for the next half month. 

Besides, current status for the rest of the two payments:
1. Second payment, 4000usd to your cmb account, on the way, the bank will let me know;
2. Third payment to Xurry, the bank still rejected the payment though Xurry tried her best to proof. She may have or will ask the bank to return it these two days.

Thnaks for your kindly help for the payment, and since we got the first 5980usd, we will have more time to figure out how to transfer money to China. In my opinion, maybe you pay usd to Adeh then Adeh give us CNY is the easiest way if Adeh feel no trouble.

Dear Elisabeth,

Thank you. I'm looking through the requirements and the application. It says it takes ""at least"" two weeks - do you have any idea if it will be 2 weeks or longer? 
According to the Consult Gerneral in US, it said nornmally it will only take 4 work days. Although this is a very old post but I looked through the website and did not see they post any new annoucement about the processing time, so I think this annoucement is still valid. However, I think Chinese Embassy are a bit strict these days so may take more time to get a visa than usual. (Adeh took 2-3 monthes to apply for a reunion visa for his son Yaoyao last year which is super annoying)


For me, which is better? To use my US passport or my Dutch passport?
The only doable visa for both of you are Business visa, so please do business visa for yourself too. I think it does not matter which passport you use.

Dear ELisabeth,

So both you and Ulrich will need to apply for a new business visa. (so far the easiest one)
Here is the lastest China visa application instructions: http://newyork.china-consulate.gov.cn/eng/tzgg/202301/t20230109_11004155.htm
According the link above, kudelabs will need to offer you two invitation letters for business visa. We wll make them next Monday and send them back to you.

Did you hear anything from the recipient bank about this having been returned? 
I’m 90% sure it was never sent.
I checked with the bank twice last week, they said there is only one payment (5980usd) was transferred to your CMB account during the past one month. 


Oh! That’s probably easiest. @xurry would that work? To which address should I send it? 
Xurry and I just talked, the trouble we have to receive money from you is all because of Panama. So the easiest way to do is you transfer USD to Adeh's US bank account, then Adeh using his US bank account to transfer money to my China Bank account. Xurry is using David's paypal, so maybe it would be best if we don't need to involve David in.

Dear Adeh and Ulrich, could you please see if this work fine with you guys?



I ended up being able to cancel the $4000 recurring transfer, and don’t see any evidence that any $4000 transfers actually went out. 

CATHY: OK, Thanks for checking, I just wanna mask sure the $4000 is trackable.

Did you hear anything from the recipient bank about this having been returned?

Meanwhile, apparently the $6000 transfers was returned, and the $5980 one was not returned so you should have received that. 

CATHY: Correct, we have received the $5980 payment, and this is the only one payment we received so far.

Ok, great. 


I that consistent with what you know? Any money in limbo still? 

CATHY: Yes. The balance is around 20,000RMB now, but we will need at least 10,000RMB more to cover the expense this month. 

And, how do I send more now? 

CATHY: Can we try paypal? @Xurry

Oh! That’s probably easiest. @xurry would that work? To which address should I send it?

Dear Boss,

We have received the first ppayment, which is 5980usd to your CMB account yesterday, so we should be OK for the next half month. 

Besides, current status for the rest of the two payments:
1. Second payment, 4000usd to your cmb account, on the way, the bank will let me know;
2. Third payment to Xurry, the bank still rejected the payment though Xurry tried her best to proof. She may have or will ask the bank to return it these two days.

Thnaks for your kindly help for the payment, and since we got the first 5980usd, we will have more time to figure out how to transfer money to China. In my opinion, maybe you pay usd to Adeh then Adeh give us CNY is the easiest way if Adeh feel no trouble.

Dear Elisabeth,

Thank you. I'm looking through the requirements and the application. It says it takes ""at least"" two weeks - do you have any idea if it will be 2 weeks or longer? 
According to the Consult Gerneral in US, it said nornmally it will only take 4 work days. Although this is a very old post but I looked through the website and did not see they post any new annoucement about the processing time, so I think this annoucement is still valid. However, I think Chinese Embassy are a bit strict these days so may take more time to get a visa than usual. (Adeh took 2-3 monthes to apply for a reunion visa for his son Yaoyao last year which is super annoying)


For me, which is better? To use my US passport or my Dutch passport?
The only doable visa for both of you are Business visa, so please do business visa for yourself too. I think it does not matter which passport you use.

Dear ELisabeth,

According to China Consulate Gerneral in NewYork, at the current stage, multi-year multiple-entry visas issued before March 26, 2020 are still suspended of use. 
So both you and Ulrich will need to apply for a new business visa. (so far the easiest one)
Here is the lastest China visa application instructions: http://newyork.china-consulate.gov.cn/eng/tzgg/202301/t20230109_11004155.htm
According the link above, kudelabs will need to offer you two invitation letters for business visa. We wll make them next Monday and send them back to you.

Have a nice day!

Thank you. I'm looking through the requirements and the application. It says it takes ""at least"" two weeks - do you have any idea if it will be 2 weeks or longer? 
According to the Consult Gerneral in US, it said nornmally it will only take 4 work days. Although this is a very old post but I looked through the website and did not see they post any new annoucement about the processing time, so I think this annoucement is still valid. However, I think Chinese Embassy are a bit strict these days so may take more time to get a visa than usual. (Adeh took 2-3 monthes to apply for a reunion visa for his son Yaoyao last year which is super annoying)


For me, which is better? To use my US passport or my Dutch passport?
The only doable visa for both of you are Business visa, so please do business visa for yourself too. I think it does not matter which passport you use.

Dear ELisabeth,

According to China Consulate Gerneral in NewYork, at the current stage, multi-year multiple-entry visas issued before March 26, 2020 are still suspended of use. 
So both you and Ulrich will need to apply for a new business visa. (so far the easiest one)
Here is the lastest China visa application instructions: http://newyork.china-consulate.gov.cn/eng/tzgg/202301/t20230109_11004155.htm
According the link above, kudelabs will need to offer you two invitation letters for business visa. We wll make them next Monday and send them back to you.

Have a nice day!

Cathy


Thank you! 
What is involved in getting a work visa for Ulrich to enter? 
I still have my 10-year business visa that I got before the pandemic, but I think Ulrich's is expired. Do you know if that still works?

Did you hear anything from the recipient bank about this having been returned? 
I’m 90% sure it was never sent.
I checked with the bank twice last week, they said there is only one payment (5980usd) was transferred to your CMB account during the past one month. 


Oh! That’s probably easiest. @xurry would that work? To which address should I send it? 
Xurry and I just talked, the trouble we have to receive money from you is all because of Panama. So the easiest way to do is you transfer USD to Adeh's US bank account, then Adeh using his US bank account to transfer money to my China Bank account. Xurry is using David's paypal, so maybe it would be best if we don't need to involve David in.

Dear Adeh and Ulrich, could you please see if this work fine with you guys?



I ended up being able to cancel the $4000 recurring transfer, and don’t see any evidence that any $4000 transfers actually went out. 

CATHY: OK, Thanks for checking, I just wanna mask sure the $4000 is trackable.

Did you hear anything from the recipient bank about this having been returned? 
I’m 90% sure it was never sent. 


Meanwhile, apparently the $6000 transfers was returned, and the $5980 one was not returned so you should have received that. 

CATHY: Correct, we have received the $5980 payment, and this is the only one payment we received so far.

Ok, great. 


I that consistent with what you know? Any money in limbo still? 

CATHY: Yes. The balance is around 20,000RMB now, but we will need at least 10,000RMB more to cover the expense this month. 

And, how do I send more now? 

CATHY: Can we try paypal? @Xurry

Oh! That’s probably easiest. @xurry would that work? To which address should I send it? 



Thanks for your patience. What a mess!

Please check and see if the payment is automatically refund to your HSBC account, and we will need to figure out the way to transfer money to Kude before the end of this month.

So far, we only receivd the first 6000USD to your CMB account, the third payment to Xurry is refunded, please also check if it has arrived or not.

Dear Boss,

We have received the first ppayment, which is 5980usd to your CMB account yesterday, so we should be OK for the next half month. 

Besides, current status for the rest of the two payments:
1. Second payment, 4000usd to your cmb account, on the way, the bank will let me know;
2. Third payment to Xurry, the bank still rejected the payment though Xurry tried her best to proof. She may have or will ask the bank to return it these two days.

Thnaks for your kindly help for the payment, and since we got the first 5980usd, we will have more time to figure out how to transfer money to China. In my opinion, maybe you pay usd to Adeh then Adeh give us CNY is the easiest way if Adeh feel no trouble.

Yeah, I can try. But note that my ability to transfer has also been pretty limited. After I sent money to Fiona she’s had her account flagged and I can only exchange if I bring Fa-piao into the bank.

But yeah, it’s worth a try.

Dear Adeh,

Is that OK for you to transfer USD to me? Xurry and I think this may be the easiest way for Ulrich to transfer money to Kude office account.
(Ulrich to Adeh, Adeh to Cathy/Xurry)

Kude office account will need money soon, we don't have money to pay salary for Ayi and cook after paying Office rent 4 days later. Please see if this is doable for you and Ulrich.

Pleas let me know, many thanks!!

Did you hear anything from the recipient bank about this having been returned? 
I’m 90% sure it was never sent.
I checked with the bank twice last week, they said there is only one payment (5980usd) was transferred to your CMB account during the past one month. 


Oh! That’s probably easiest. @xurry would that work? To which address should I send it? 
Xurry and I just talked, the trouble we have to receive money from you is all because of Panama. So the easiest way to do is you transfer USD to Adeh's US bank account, then Adeh using his US bank account to transfer money to my China Bank account. Xurry is using David's paypal, so maybe it would be best if we don't need to involve David in.

Dear Adeh and Ulrich, could you please see if this work fine with you guys?



I ended up being able to cancel the $4000 recurring transfer, and don’t see any evidence that any $4000 transfers actually went out. 

CATHY: OK, Thanks for checking, I just wanna mask sure the $4000 is trackable.

Did you hear anything from the recipient bank about this having been returned? 
I’m 90% sure it was never sent. 


Meanwhile, apparently the $6000 transfers was returned, and the $5980 one was not returned so you should have received that. 

CATHY: Correct, we have received the $5980 payment, and this is the only one payment we received so far.

Ok, great. 


I that consistent with what you know? Any money in limbo still? 

CATHY: Yes. The balance is around 20,000RMB now, but we will need at least 10,000RMB more to cover the expense this month. 

And, how do I send more now? 

CATHY: Can we try paypal? @Xurry

Oh! That’s probably easiest. @xurry would that work? To which address should I send it? 



Thanks for your patience. What a mess!

Reminder,

Sir, please check the status of the second payment to your CMB account. (4000USD) I just checked with the bank said still no transcation is in these days.

And we will need to figure out the money transaction methods, best before the end of last week. (Nov.20)

Dear Ulrich,

I just called CMB to check your second payment to your CMB account(4000USD), and the bank said they still have not received it. 
Please check and see if the payment is automatically refund to your HSBC account, and we will need to figure out the way to transfer money to Kude before the end of this month.

So far, we only receivd the first 6000USD to your CMB account, the third payment to Xurry is refunded, please also check if it has arrived or not.

Thank you so much!

Subject: Re: Sending money to Kude

Dear Boss,

We have received the first ppayment, which is 5980usd to your CMB account yesterday, so we should be OK for the next half month. 

Besides, current status for the rest of the two payments:
1. Second payment, 4000usd to your cmb account, on the way, the bank will let me know;
2. Third payment to Xurry, the bank still rejected the payment though Xurry tried her best to proof. She may have or will ask the bank to return it these two days.

Thnaks for your kindly help for the payment, and since we got the first 5980usd, we will have more time to figure out how to transfer money to China. In my opinion, maybe you pay usd to Adeh then Adeh give us CNY is the easiest way if Adeh feel no trouble.

Adeh, 

Since I moved from HK to Panama, I changed the address on all my bank accounts to Panama. 
And now, Chinese banks won’t accept wires from me any more. 
Xurry&Cathy urgently need $6000…. Do you have enough in China to help out? 
More generally - maybe I can pay you in the US and then you send the money the company needs?

When I finally left that job for one that I really liked and was good at, I was happy and on cloud 9. Now the last time I worked a cold-calling sales jobs was three years. However last night I had a nightmare that I was working that type of job again and I was still really bad at it, it was a huge blow to my self-esteem and ego, it made me feel like I had downgraded in life.

"2 / 2We have an assignment in which we are doing exploratory data analysis. I need your help during the process. Here's the assignment and code I have so far:

######### Assignment ########
## Task
We will be focusing on the yelp business dataset to do an exploratory analysis. This dataset provides information about businesses, user reviews, and more from Yelp's database. The data is split into separate files (business, checkin, photos, review, tip, and user), and is available in either JSON or SQL format. You might use this to investigate the distributions of scores on yelp, look at how many reviews users typically leave or look for regional trends about restaurants. Note that this is a large, structured dataset and you don't need to look at all of the data to answer interesting questions.

Prior to analysis – you should write down an initial set of at least three questions you'd like to investigate.

Next, you will perform an exploratory analysis of your dataset using a visualization tool such as Vega-Lite/Altair or Tableau. You should consider two different phases of exploration.

In the first phase, you should seek to gain an overview of the shape & structure of your dataset. What variables does the dataset contain? How are they distributed? Are there any notable data quality issues? Are there any surprising relationships among the variables? Be sure to perform ""sanity checks"" for any patterns you expect the data to contain.

In the second phase, you should investigate your initial questions, as well as any new questions that arise during your exploration. For each question, start by creating a visualization that might provide a useful answer. Then refine the visualization (by adding additional variables, changing sorting or axis scales, filtering or subsetting data, etc.) to develop better perspectives, explore unexpected observations, or sanity check your assumptions. You should repeat this process for each of your questions, but feel free to revise your questions or branch off to explore new questions if the data warrants.

## Final Deliverable
Your final submission should take the form of a sequence of images – similar to a comic book – that consists of 8 or more visualizations detailing your most important observations.
Your observations can include important surprises or issues (such as data quality problems affecting your analysis) as well as responses to your analysis questions. Where appropriate, we encourage you to include annotated visualizations to guide viewers' attention and provide interpretive context. (If you aren't sure what we mean by ""annotated visualization,"" see this page for some examples.)
Provide sufficient detail such that anyone can read your report and understand what you've learned without already being familiar with the dataset. To help gauge the scope of this assignment, see this example report analyzing motion picture data.

"2 / 2We have an assignment in which we are doing exploratory data analysis. I need your help during the process. Here's the assignment and code I have so far:

######### Assignment ########
## Task
We will be focusing on the yelp business dataset to do an exploratory analysis. This dataset provides information about businesses, user reviews, and more from Yelp's database. The data is split into separate files (business, checkin, photos, review, tip, and user), and is available in either JSON or SQL format. You might use this to investigate the distributions of scores on yelp, look at how many reviews users typically leave or look for regional trends about restaurants. Note that this is a large, structured dataset and you don't need to look at all of the data to answer interesting questions.

Prior to analysis – you should write down an initial set of at least three questions you'd like to investigate.

Next, you will perform an exploratory analysis of your dataset using a visualization tool such as Vega-Lite/Altair or Tableau. You should consider two different phases of exploration.

In the first phase, you should seek to gain an overview of the shape & structure of your dataset. What variables does the dataset contain? How are they distributed? Are there any notable data quality issues? Are there any surprising relationships among the variables? Be sure to perform ""sanity checks"" for any patterns you expect the data to contain.

In the second phase, you should investigate your initial questions, as well as any new questions that arise during your exploration. For each question, start by creating a visualization that might provide a useful answer. Then refine the visualization (by adding additional variables, changing sorting or axis scales, filtering or subsetting data, etc.) to develop better perspectives, explore unexpected observations, or sanity check your assumptions. You should repeat this process for each of your questions, but feel free to revise your questions or branch off to explore new questions if the data warrants.

## Final Deliverable
Your final submission should take the form of a sequence of images – similar to a comic book – that consists of 8 or more visualizations detailing your most important observations.
Your observations can include important surprises or issues (such as data quality problems affecting your analysis) as well as responses to your analysis questions.

"2 / 2We have an assignment in which we are doing exploratory data analysis. I need your help during the process. Here's the assignment and code I have so far:

######### Assignment ########
## Task
We will be focusing on the yelp business dataset to do an exploratory analysis. This dataset provides information about businesses, user reviews, and more from Yelp's database. The data is split into separate files (business, checkin, photos, review, tip, and user), and is available in either JSON or SQL format. You might use this to investigate the distributions of scores on yelp, look at how many reviews users typically leave or look for regional trends about restaurants. Note that this is a large, structured dataset and you don't need to look at all of the data to answer interesting questions.

Prior to analysis – you should write down an initial set of at least three questions you'd like to investigate.

Next, you will perform an exploratory analysis of your dataset using a visualization tool such as Vega-Lite/Altair or Tableau. You should consider two different phases of exploration.

In the first phase, you should seek to gain an overview of the shape & structure of your dataset. What variables does the dataset contain? How are they distributed? Are there any notable data quality issues? Are there any surprising relationships among the variables? Be sure to perform ""sanity checks"" for any patterns you expect the data to contain.

In the second phase, you should investigate your initial questions, as well as any new questions that arise during your exploration. For each question, start by creating a visualization that might provide a useful answer. Then refine the visualization (by adding additional variables, changing sorting or axis scales, filtering or subsetting data, etc.) to develop better perspectives, explore unexpected observations, or sanity check your assumptions. You should repeat this process for each of your questions, but feel free to revise your questions or branch off to explore new questions if the data warrants.

## Final Deliverable
Your final submission should take the form of a sequence of images – similar to a comic book – that consists of 8 or more visualizations detailing your most important observations.
Your observations can include important surprises or issues (such as data quality problems affecting your analysis) as well as responses to your analysis questions. Where appropriate, we encourage you to include annotated visualizations to guide viewers' attention and provide interpretive context. (If you aren't sure what we mean by ""annotated visualization,"" see this page for some examples.)
Provide sufficient detail such that anyone can read your report and understand what you've learned without already being familiar with the dataset. To help gauge the scope of this assignment, see this example report analyzing motion picture data.

"2 / 2We have an assignment in which we are doing exploratory data analysis. I need your help during the process. Here's the assignment and code I have so far:

######### Assignment ########
## Task
We will be focusing on the yelp business dataset to do an exploratory analysis. This dataset provides information about businesses, user reviews, and more from Yelp's database. The data is split into separate files (business, checkin, photos, review, tip, and user), and is available in either JSON or SQL format. You might use this to investigate the distributions of scores on yelp, look at how many reviews users typically leave or look for regional trends about restaurants. Note that this is a large, structured dataset and you don't need to look at all of the data to answer interesting questions.

Prior to analysis – you should write down an initial set of at least three questions you'd like to investigate.

Next, you will perform an exploratory analysis of your dataset using a visualization tool such as Vega-Lite/Altair or Tableau. You should consider two different phases of exploration.

In the first phase, you should seek to gain an overview of the shape & structure of your dataset. What variables does the dataset contain? How are they distributed? Are there any notable data quality issues? Are there any surprising relationships among the variables? Be sure to perform ""sanity checks"" for any patterns you expect the data to contain.

In the second phase, you should investigate your initial questions, as well as any new questions that arise during your exploration. For each question, start by creating a visualization that might provide a useful answer. Then refine the visualization (by adding additional variables, changing sorting or axis scales, filtering or subsetting data, etc.) to develop better perspectives, explore unexpected observations, or sanity check your assumptions. You should repeat this process for each of your questions, but feel free to revise your questions or branch off to explore new questions if the data warrants.

## Final Deliverable
Your final submission should take the form of a sequence of images – similar to a comic book – that consists of 8 or more visualizations detailing your most important observations.
Your observations can include important surprises or issues (such as data quality problems affecting your analysis) as well as responses to your analysis questions. Where appropriate, we encourage you to include annotated visualizations to guide viewers' attention and provide interpretive context. (If you aren't sure what we mean by ""annotated visualization,"" see this page for some examples.)
Provide sufficient detail such that anyone can read your report and understand what you've learned without already being familiar with the dataset. To help gauge the scope of this assignment, see this example report analyzing motion picture data.

"Hi! I'm the CEO of Trackingplan, an technology company focused on helping Scaleups and enterprises to make sure their tracking and analytics is working properly. 

I have a team of 5 engineers, 2 PMs, 2 Marketers. All of them remote.

The CTO has a phd on ML, and I have an executive masters on AI too.

I want my team to be able to leverage AI for doing their work, not only as developers, but also as PMs and marketers, but right now they have no time to study this, and I feel they are not taking the time to ""think AI"" it in their free time (I think that's their responsability, but that's other story). The result is that they never think first about how AI can help to solve their work problems, or that they haven't included AI in their mindset when trying to find solution to our customers problems. They dont know the existing tools, (like you), or the others around that can help be better at coding, marketing, designing, etc. 

Another objective is to make this fun, as the team morale is not as high as it should be. 

My initial idea is to dedicate one cycle (where noone has to do their regular work) to it. Our cycles are 2 weeks. You can think about it like a hackathon around the topic. 

Rought timeline would be:
Weeks before the ""cycle"" (that will happen on the first 2 weeks of may), we will announce our plans and share some basic videos, and articles, tweets etc to make sure everyone is warmed up before the hackathon starts.

Then, make a proposal like: 
Spend the next 2 days researching which AI projects you want to be done by the end of the cycle. We will encourage them to be Trackingplan related, that improve our product, but they can be things like ""testing productized that help our processes"", or ""things that improve our codebase"", or ""automate manual processes that we have to code right now"".

Then, lets say the wednesday or thursday that week, we do a video call where everyone proposes what they want to do in the remaing 6-7 work days. As we are only 8 people, we can spend like 30 min discussing their ideas and giving feedback. The next day, in the morning, they will have to have a idea of which ideas to attack, and we will allow them to do in pairs. I'm worried in that transition from ""my idea"" to ""someone else idea"", as I dont want people to be just looking others doing the work, but I think it will be more fun.

Then, at the end of the cycle, lets say next friday, we will spend all the day at a show and tell, where every team shows what they have done. 

Do you think there are any risks on this idea?",resp_none,resp_v1,B

"give me 5 bullets of the most important things from this:

What keeps us healthy and happy
0:15
as we go through life?
0:18
If you were going to invest now
0:21
in your future best self,
0:23
where would you put your time and your energy?
0:27
There was a recent survey of millennials
0:29
asking them what their most important life goals were,
0:34
and over 80 percent said
0:36
that a major life goal for them was to get rich.
0:40
And another 50 percent of those same young adults
0:45
said that another major life goal
0:47
was to become famous.
0:50
(Laughter)
0:52
And we're constantly told to lean in to work, to push harder
0:58
and achieve more.
1:00
We're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after
1:04
in order to have a good life.
1:06
Pictures of entire lives,
1:08
of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them,
1:13
those pictures are almost impossible to get.
1:18
Most of what we know about human life
1:21
we know from asking people to remember the past,
1:24
and as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20.
1:29
We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life,
1:33
and sometimes memory is downright creative.
1:36
But what if we could watch entire lives
1:41
as they unfold through time?
1:44
What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers
1:48
all the way into old age
1:50
to see what really keeps people happy and healthy?
1:55
We did that.
1:57
The Harvard Study of Adult Development
1:59
may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done.
2:05
For 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men,
2:13
year after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health,
2:17
and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories
2:22
were going to turn out.
2:25
Studies like this are exceedingly rare.
2:28
Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade
2:33
because too many people drop out of the study,
2:36
or funding for the research dries up,
2:39
or the researchers get distracted,
2:41
or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field.
2:46
But through a combination of luck
2:48
and the persistence of several generations of researchers,
2:52
this study has survived.
2:54
About 60 of our original 724 men
2:59
are still alive,
3:00
still participating in the study,
3:02
most of them in their 90s.
3:05
And we are now beginning to study
3:07
the more than 2,000 children of these men.
3:11
And I'm the fourth director of the study.
3:15
Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men.
3:20
The first group started in the study
3:22
when they were sophomores at Harvard College.
3:25
They all finished college during World War II,
3:27
and then most went off to serve in the war.
3:31
And the second group that we've followed
3:33
was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods,
3:37
boys who were chosen for the study
3:39
specifically because they were from some of the most troubled
3:43
and disadvantaged families
3:44
in the Boston of the 1930s.
3:47
Most lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water.
3:54
When they entered the study,
3:56
all of these teenagers were interviewed.
3:59
They were given medical exams.
4:01
We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents.
4:05
And then these teenagers grew up into adults
4:07
who entered all walks of life.
4:10
They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors,
4:16
one President of the United States.
4:20
Some developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia.
4:25
Some climbed the social ladder
4:27
from the bottom all the way to the very top,
4:30
and some made that journey in the opposite direction.
4:35
The founders of this study
4:38
would never in their wildest dreams
4:40
have imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later,
4:45
telling you that the study still continues.
4:49
Every two years, our patient and dedicated research staff
4:52
calls up our men and asks them if we can send them
4:56
yet one more set of questions about their lives.
5:00
Many of the inner city Boston men ask us,
5:03
""Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting.""
5:08
The Harvard men never ask that question.
5:11
(Laughter)
5:20
To get the clearest picture of these lives,
5:23
we don't just send them questionnaires.
5:26
We interview them in their living rooms.
5:29
We get their medical records from their doctors.
5:32
We draw their blood, we scan their brains,
5:34
we talk to their children.
5:36
We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns.
5:41
And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives
5:45
if they would join us as members of the study,
5:47
many of the women said, ""You know, it's about time.""
5:50
(Laughter)
5:51
So what have we learned?
5:53
What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages
5:58
of information that we've generated
6:01
on these lives?
6:03
Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder.
6:10
The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this:
6:16
Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.
6:23
We've learned three big lessons about relationships.
6:26
The first is that social connections are really good for us,
6:30
and that loneliness kills.
6:33
It turns out that people who are more socially connected
6:37
to family, to friends, to community,
6:40
are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer
6:45
than people who are less well connected.
6:48
And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.
6:51
People who are more isolated than they want to be from others
6:57
find that they are less happy,
7:00
their health declines earlier in midlife,
7:03
their brain functioning declines sooner
7:05
and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely.
7:10
And the sad fact is that at any given time,
7:13
more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.
7:19
And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd
7:21
and you can be lonely in a marriage,
7:24
so the second big lesson that we learned
7:26
is that it's not just the number of friends you have,
7:29
and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship,
7:33
but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters.
7:38
It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health.
7:43
High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection,
7:47
turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.
7:53
And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.
7:57
Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s,
8:01
we wanted to look back at them at midlife
8:04
and to see if we could predict
8:05
who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian
8:09
and who wasn't.
8:11
And when we gathered together everything we knew about them
8:15
at age 50,
8:18
it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels
8:20
that predicted how they were going to grow old.
8:23
It was how satisfied they were in their relationships.
8:27
The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50
8:31
were the healthiest at age 80.
8:35
And good, close relationships seem to buffer us
8:38
from some of the slings and arrows of getting old.
8:42
Our most happily partnered men and women
8:46
reported, in their 80s,
8:48
that on the days when they had more physical pain,
8:51
their mood stayed just as happy.
8:54
But the people who were in unhappy relationships,
8:57
on the days when they reported more physical pain,
9:00
it was magnified by more emotional pain.
9:04
And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health
9:08
is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies,
9:12
they protect our brains.
9:14
It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship
9:19
to another person in your 80s is protective,
9:23
that the people who are in relationships
9:25
where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need,
9:29
those people's memories stay sharper longer.
9:32
And the people in relationships
9:34
where they feel they really can't count on the other one,
9:37
those are the people who experience earlier memory decline.
9:42
And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time.
9:46
Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other
9:49
day in and day out,
9:51
but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other
9:54
when the going got tough,
9:56
those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.
10:01
So this message,
10:04
that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being,
10:10
this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.
10:13
Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore?
10:17
Well, we're human.
10:19
What we'd really like is a quick fix,
10:21
something we can get
10:23
that'll make our lives good and keep them that way.
10:27
Relationships are messy and they're complicated
10:30
and the hard work of tending to family and friends,
10:34
it's not sexy or glamorous.
10:37
It's also lifelong. It never ends.
10:40
The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement
10:45
were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates.
10:51
Just like the millennials in that recent survey,
10:54
many of our men when they were starting out as young adults
10:58
really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement
11:02
were what they needed to go after to have a good life.
11:06
But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown
11:10
that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships,
11:16
with family, with friends, with community.
11:21
So what about you?
11:23
Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60.
11:27
What might leaning in to relationships even look like?
11:31
Well, the possibilities are practically endless.
11:35
It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time
11:41
or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,
11:46
long walks or date nights,
11:49
or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years,
11:54
because those all-too-common family feuds
11:57
take a terrible toll
12:00
on the people who hold the grudges.
12:04
I'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain.
12:09
More than a century ago,
12:11
he was looking back on his life,
12:14
and he wrote this:
12:16
""There isn't time, so brief is life,
12:20
for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account.
12:26
There is only time for loving,
12:29
and but an instant, so to speak, for that.""
12:34
The good life is built with good relationships.

6:33
It turns out that people who are more socially connected
6:37
to family, to friends, to community,
6:40
are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer
6:45
than people who are less well connected.
6:48
And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.
6:51
People who are more isolated than they want to be from others
6:57
find that they are less happy,
7:00
their health declines earlier in midlife,
7:03
their brain functioning declines sooner
7:05
and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely.
7:10
And the sad fact is that at any given time,
7:13
more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.
7:19
And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd
7:21
and you can be lonely in a marriage,
7:24
so the second big lesson that we learned
7:26
is that it's not just the number of friends you have,
7:29
and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship,
7:33
but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters.
7:38
It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health.
7:43
High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection,
7:47
turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.
7:53
And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.
7:57
Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s,
8:01
we wanted to look back at them at midlife
8:04
and to see if we could predict
8:05
who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian
8:09
and who wasn't.
8:11
And when we gathered together everything we knew about them
8:15
at age 50,
8:18
it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels
8:20
that predicted how they were going to grow old.
8:23
It was how satisfied they were in their relationships.
8:27
The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50
8:31
were the healthiest at age 80.
8:35
And good, close relationships seem to buffer us
8:38
from some of the slings and arrows of getting old.
8:42
Our most happily partnered men and women
8:46
reported, in their 80s,
8:48
that on the days when they had more physical pain,
8:51
their mood stayed just as happy.
8:54
But the people who were in unhappy relationships,
8:57
on the days when they reported more physical pain,
9:00
it was magnified by more emotional pain.
9:04
And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health
9:08
is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies,
9:12
they protect our brains.
9:14
It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship
9:19
to another person in your 80s is protective,
9:23
that the people who are in relationships
9:25
where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need,
9:29
those people's memories stay sharper longer.
9:32
And the people in relationships
9:34
where they feel they really can't count on the other one,
9:37
those are the people who experience earlier memory decline.
9:42
And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time.
9:46
Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other
9:49
day in and day out,
9:51
but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other
9:54
when the going got tough,
9:56
those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.
10:01
So this message,
10:04
that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being,
10:10
this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.
10:13
Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore?
10:17
Well, we're human.
10:19
What we'd really like is a quick fix,
10:21
something we can get
10:23
that'll make our lives good and keep them that way.
10:27
Relationships are messy and they're complicated
10:30
and the hard work of tending to family and friends,
10:34
it's not sexy or glamorous.
10:37
It's also lifelong. It never ends.
10:40
The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement
10:45
were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates.
10:51
Just like the millennials in that recent survey,
10:54
many of our men when they were starting out as young adults
10:58
really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement
11:02
were what they needed to go after to have a good life.
11:06
But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown
11:10
that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships,
11:16
with family, with friends, with community.
11:21
So what about you?
11:23
Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60.
11:27
What might leaning in to relationships even look like?
11:31
Well, the possibilities are practically endless.
11:35
It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time
11:41
or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,
11:46
long walks or date nights,
11:49
or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years,
11:54
because those all-too-common family feuds
11:57
take a terrible toll
12:00
on the people who hold the grudges.
12:04
I'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain.
12:09
More than a century ago,
12:11
he was looking back on his life,
12:14
and he wrote this:
12:16
""There isn't time, so brief is life,
12:20
for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account.
12:26
There is only time for loving,
12:29
and but an instant, so to speak, for that.""
12:34
The good life is built with good relationships.

"give me 5 bullets of the most important things from this:

What keeps us healthy and happy
0:15
as we go through life?
0:18
If you were going to invest now
0:21
in your future best self,
0:23
where would you put your time and your energy?
0:27
There was a recent survey of millennials
0:29
asking them what their most important life goals were,
0:34
and over 80 percent said
0:36
that a major life goal for them was to get rich.
0:40
And another 50 percent of those same young adults
0:45
said that another major life goal
0:47
was to become famous.
0:50
(Laughter)
0:52
And we're constantly told to lean in to work, to push harder
0:58
and achieve more.
1:00
We're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after
1:04
in order to have a good life.
1:06
Pictures of entire lives,
1:08
of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them,
1:13
those pictures are almost impossible to get.
1:18
Most of what we know about human life
1:21
we know from asking people to remember the past,
1:24
and as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20.
1:29
We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life,
1:33
and sometimes memory is downright creative.
1:36
But what if we could watch entire lives
1:41
as they unfold through time?
1:44
What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers
1:48
all the way into old age
1:50
to see what really keeps people happy and healthy?
1:55
We did that.
1:57
The Harvard Study of Adult Development
1:59
may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done.
2:05
For 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men,
2:13
year after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health,
2:17
and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories
2:22
were going to turn out.
2:25
Studies like this are exceedingly rare.
2:28
Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade
2:33
because too many people drop out of the study,
2:36
or funding for the research dries up,
2:39
or the researchers get distracted,
2:41
or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field.
2:46
But through a combination of luck
2:48
and the persistence of several generations of researchers,
2:52
this study has survived.
2:54
About 60 of our original 724 men
2:59
are still alive,
3:00
still participating in the study,
3:02
most of them in their 90s.
3:05
And we are now beginning to study
3:07
the more than 2,000 children of these men.
3:11
And I'm the fourth director of the study.
3:15
Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men.
3:20
The first group started in the study
3:22
when they were sophomores at Harvard College.
3:25
They all finished college during World War II,
3:27
and then most went off to serve in the war.
3:31
And the second group that we've followed
3:33
was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods,
3:37
boys who were chosen for the study
3:39
specifically because they were from some of the most troubled
3:43
and disadvantaged families
3:44
in the Boston of the 1930s.
3:47
Most lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water.
3:54
When they entered the study,
3:56
all of these teenagers were interviewed.
3:59
They were given medical exams.
4:01
We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents.
4:05
And then these teenagers grew up into adults
4:07
who entered all walks of life.
4:10
They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors,
4:16
one President of the United States.
4:20
Some developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia.
4:25
Some climbed the social ladder
4:27
from the bottom all the way to the very top,
4:30
and some made that journey in the opposite direction.
4:35
The founders of this study
4:38
would never in their wildest dreams
4:40
have imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later,
4:45
telling you that the study still continues.
4:49
Every two years, our patient and dedicated research staff
4:52
calls up our men and asks them if we can send them
4:56
yet one more set of questions about their lives.
5:00
Many of the inner city Boston men ask us,
5:03
""Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting.""
5:08
The Harvard men never ask that question.
5:11
(Laughter)
5:20
To get the clearest picture of these lives,
5:23
we don't just send them questionnaires.
5:26
We interview them in their living rooms.
5:29
We get their medical records from their doctors.
5:32
We draw their blood, we scan their brains,
5:34
we talk to their children.
5:36
We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns.
5:41
And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives
5:45
if they would join us as members of the study,
5:47
many of the women said, ""You know, it's about time.""
5:50
(Laughter)
5:51
So what have we learned?
5:53
What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages
5:58
of information that we've generated
6:01
on these lives?
6:03
Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder.
6:10
The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this:
6:16
Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.
6:23
We've learned three big lessons about relationships.
6:26
The first is that social connections are really good for us,
6:30
and that loneliness kills.
6:33
It turns out that people who are more socially connected
6:37
to family, to friends, to community,
6:40
are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer
6:45

6:48

7:13
more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.

6:45
than people who are less well connected.
6:48
And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.
6:51
People who are more isolated than they want to be from others
6:57
find that they are less happy,
7:00
their health declines earlier in midlife,
7:03
their brain functioning declines sooner
7:05
and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely.
7:10
And the sad fact is that at any given time,
7:13
more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.
7:19
And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd
7:21
and you can be lonely in a marriage,
7:24
so the second big lesson that we learned
7:26
is that it's not just the number of friends you have,
7:29
and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship,
7:33
but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters.
7:38
It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health.
7:43
High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection,
7:47
turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.
7:53
And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.
7:57
Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s,
8:01
we wanted to look back at them at midlife
8:04
and to see if we could predict
8:05
who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian
8:09
and who wasn't.
8:11
And when we gathered together everything we knew about them
8:15
at age 50,
8:18
it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels
8:20
that predicted how they were going to grow old.
8:23
It was how satisfied they were in their relationships.
8:27
The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50
8:31
were the healthiest at age 80.
8:35
And good, close relationships seem to buffer us
8:38
from some of the slings and arrows of getting old.
8:42
Our most happily partnered men and women
8:46
reported, in their 80s,
8:48
that on the days when they had more physical pain,
8:51
their mood stayed just as happy.
8:54
But the people who were in unhappy relationships,
8:57
on the days when they reported more physical pain,
9:00
it was magnified by more emotional pain.
9:04
And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health
9:08
is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies,
9:12
they protect our brains.
9:14
It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship
9:19
to another person in your 80s is protective,
9:23
that the people who are in relationships
9:25
where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need,
9:29
those people's memories stay sharper longer.
9:32
And the people in relationships
9:34
where they feel they really can't count on the other one,
9:37
those are the people who experience earlier memory decline.
9:42
And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time.
9:46
Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other
9:49
day in and day out,
9:51
but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other
9:54
when the going got tough,
9:56
those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.
10:01
So this message,
10:04
that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being,
10:10
this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.
10:13
Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore?
10:17
Well, we're human.
10:19
What we'd really like is a quick fix,
10:21
something we can get
10:23
that'll make our lives good and keep them that way.
10:27
Relationships are messy and they're complicated
10:30
and the hard work of tending to family and friends,
10:34
it's not sexy or glamorous.
10:37
It's also lifelong. It never ends.
10:40
The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement
10:45
were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates.
10:51
Just like the millennials in that recent survey,
10:54
many of our men when they were starting out as young adults
10:58
really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement
11:02
were what they needed to go after to have a good life.
11:06
But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown
11:10
that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships,
11:16
with family, with friends, with community.
11:21
So what about you?
11:23
Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60.
11:27
What might leaning in to relationships even look like?
11:31
Well, the possibilities are practically endless.
11:35
It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time
11:41
or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,
11:46
long walks or date nights,
11:49
or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years,
11:54
because those all-too-common family feuds
11:57
take a terrible toll
12:00
on the people who hold the grudges.
12:04
I'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain.
12:09
More than a century ago,
12:11
he was looking back on his life,
12:14
and he wrote this:
12:16
""There isn't time, so brief is life,
12:20
for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account.
12:26
There is only time for loving,
12:29
and but an instant, so to speak, for that.""
12:34
The good life is built with good relationships.
12:39
Thank you.",resp_v1,resp_v2,B
"give me 5 bullets of the most important things from this:

What keeps us healthy and happy
0:15
as we go through life?
0:18
If you were going to invest now
0:21
in your future best self,
0:23
where would you put your time and your energy?
0:27
There was a recent survey of millennials
0:29
asking them what their most important life goals were,
0:34
and over 80 percent said
0:36
that a major life goal for them was to get rich.
0:40
And another 50 percent of those same young adults
0:45
said that another major life goal
0:47
was to become famous.
0:50
(Laughter)
0:52
And we're constantly told to lean in to work, to push harder
0:58
and achieve more.
1:00
We're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after
1:04
in order to have a good life.
1:06
Pictures of entire lives,
1:08
of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them,
1:13
those pictures are almost impossible to get.
1:18
Most of what we know about human life
1:21
we know from asking people to remember the past,
1:24
and as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20.
1:29
We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life,
1:33
and sometimes memory is downright creative.
1:36
But what if we could watch entire lives
1:41
as they unfold through time?
1:44
What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers
1:48
all the way into old age
1:50
to see what really keeps people happy and healthy?
1:55
We did that.
1:57
The Harvard Study of Adult Development
1:59
may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done.
2:05
For 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men,
2:13
year after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health,
2:17
and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories
2:22
were going to turn out.
2:25
Studies like this are exceedingly rare.
2:28
Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade
2:33
because too many people drop out of the study,
2:36
or funding for the research dries up,
2:39
or the researchers get distracted,
2:41
or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field.
2:46
But through a combination of luck
2:48
and the persistence of several generations of researchers,
2:52
this study has survived.
2:54
About 60 of our original 724 men
2:59
are still alive,
3:00
still participating in the study,
3:02
most of them in their 90s.
3:05
And we are now beginning to study
3:07
the more than 2,000 children of these men.
3:11
And I'm the fourth director of the study.
3:15
Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men.
3:20
The first group started in the study
3:22
when they were sophomores at Harvard College.
3:25
They all finished college during World War II,
3:27
and then most went off to serve in the war.
3:31
And the second group that we've followed
3:33
was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods,
3:37
boys who were chosen for the study
3:39
specifically because they were from some of the most troubled
3:43
and disadvantaged families
3:44
in the Boston of the 1930s.
3:47
Most lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water.
3:54
When they entered the study,
3:56
all of these teenagers were interviewed.
3:59
They were given medical exams.
4:01
We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents.
4:05
And then these teenagers grew up into adults
4:07
who entered all walks of life.
4:10
They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors,
4:16
one President of the United States.
4:20
Some developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia.
4:25
Some climbed the social ladder
4:27
from the bottom all the way to the very top,
4:30
and some made that journey in the opposite direction.
4:35
The founders of this study
4:38
would never in their wildest dreams
4:40
have imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later,
4:45
telling you that the study still continues.
4:49
Every two years, our patient and dedicated research staff
4:52
calls up our men and asks them if we can send them
4:56
yet one more set of questions about their lives.
5:00
Many of the inner city Boston men ask us,
5:03
""Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting.""
5:08
The Harvard men never ask that question.
5:11
(Laughter)
5:20
To get the clearest picture of these lives,
5:23
we don't just send them questionnaires.
5:26
We interview them in their living rooms.
5:29
We get their medical records from their doctors.
5:32
We draw their blood, we scan their brains,
5:34
we talk to their children.
5:36
We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns.
5:41
And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives
5:45
if they would join us as members of the study,
5:47
many of the women said, ""You know, it's about time.""
5:50
(Laughter)
5:51
So what have we learned?
5:53
What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages
5:58
of information that we've generated
6:01
on these lives?
6:03
Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder.
6:10
The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this:
6:16
Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.
6:23
We've learned three big lessons about relationships.
6:26
The first is that social connections are really good for us,
6:30
and that loneliness kills.
6:33
It turns out that people who are more socially connected
6:37
to family, to friends, to community,
6:40
are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer
6:45
than people who are less well connected.
6:48
And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.
6:51

6:57

7:13
more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.

People who are more isolated than they want to be from others
6:57
find that they are less happy,
7:00
their health declines earlier in midlife,
7:03
their brain functioning declines sooner
7:05
and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely.
7:10
And the sad fact is that at any given time,
7:13
more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.
7:19
And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd
7:21
and you can be lonely in a marriage,
7:24
so the second big lesson that we learned
7:26
is that it's not just the number of friends you have,
7:29
and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship,
7:33
but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters.
7:38
It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health.
7:43
High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection,
7:47
turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.
7:53
And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.
7:57
Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s,
8:01
we wanted to look back at them at midlife
8:04
and to see if we could predict
8:05
who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian
8:09
and who wasn't.
8:11
And when we gathered together everything we knew about them
8:15
at age 50,
8:18
it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels
8:20
that predicted how they were going to grow old.
8:23
It was how satisfied they were in their relationships.
8:27
The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50
8:31
were the healthiest at age 80.
8:35
And good, close relationships seem to buffer us
8:38
from some of the slings and arrows of getting old.
8:42
Our most happily partnered men and women
8:46
reported, in their 80s,
8:48
that on the days when they had more physical pain,
8:51
their mood stayed just as happy.
8:54
But the people who were in unhappy relationships,
8:57
on the days when they reported more physical pain,
9:00
it was magnified by more emotional pain.
9:04
And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health
9:08
is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies,
9:12
they protect our brains.
9:14
It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship
9:19
to another person in your 80s is protective,
9:23
that the people who are in relationships
9:25
where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need,
9:29
those people's memories stay sharper longer.
9:32
And the people in relationships
9:34
where they feel they really can't count on the other one,
9:37
those are the people who experience earlier memory decline.
9:42
And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time.
9:46
Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other
9:49
day in and day out,
9:51
but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other
9:54
when the going got tough,
9:56
those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.
10:01
So this message,
10:04
that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being,
10:10
this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.
10:13
Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore?
10:17
Well, we're human.
10:19
What we'd really like is a quick fix,
10:21
something we can get
10:23
that'll make our lives good and keep them that way.
10:27
Relationships are messy and they're complicated
10:30
and the hard work of tending to family and friends,
10:34
it's not sexy or glamorous.
10:37
It's also lifelong. It never ends.
10:40
The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement
10:45
were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates.
10:51
Just like the millennials in that recent survey,
10:54
many of our men when they were starting out as young adults
10:58
really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement
11:02
were what they needed to go after to have a good life.
11:06
But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown
11:10
that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships,
11:16
with family, with friends, with community.
11:21
So what about you?
11:23
Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60.
11:27
What might leaning in to relationships even look like?
11:31
Well, the possibilities are practically endless.
11:35
It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time
11:41
or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,
11:46
long walks or date nights,
11:49
or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years,
11:54
because those all-too-common family feuds
11:57
take a terrible toll
12:00
on the people who hold the grudges.
12:04
I'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain.
12:09
More than a century ago,
12:11
he was looking back on his life,
12:14
and he wrote this:
12:16
""There isn't time, so brief is life,
12:20
for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account.
12:26
There is only time for loving,
12:29
and but an instant, so to speak, for that.""
12:34
The good life is built with good relationships.
12:39
Thank you.",resp_v2,resp_base,A

"summarize this
EZRA KLEIN: See, but I think human beings are, in a weird way on this, bad on temporal reasoning, too, which is partially why I asked the question because let’s say you think the confidence interval here is somewhere between 20 and 100 years. That matters a lot for me. I’m probably not going to be around in 100 years, almost certainly. But in terms of human history, it’s nothing — 20 to 100 years just means really soon.

And if we do get here, it’s a really big, I mean, in some ways, event horizon. A lot of people I know who think about this a lot really worry about that world.

I was very both impressed and unnerved by another A.I. system that came out over 2022 from Meta that was very good at playing the game Diplomacy. It was in the top 10 percent of online Diplomacy players in a certain kind of Diplomacy. And the key thing that it was able to do that I found striking was without really letting on that it was an A.I. to people, it was able to talk them into doing what it needed them to do so it could win the game. It was able to trick people, which is fine. That was what it was told to do, created to do.

But as these things get way better — we’ve already talked about how convincing they can be, that in many ways are getting more convincing than they are anything else at the moment — they’re going to know so much. It’s weird because OpenAI, who we’ve been talking about forever here, they were started by a bunch of people worried about A.I. misalignment. And now they just keep creating more and more powerful A.I. systems, which is another interesting insight into human nature.

But do you worry about these alignment problems? Do you worry not just about the question of an A.I. ending the world or ending humanity, but just A.I.s, I don’t know, just causing huge amounts of damage, becoming weaponry, becoming — it’s a very powerful technology that we don’t really understand what’s happening in it. And we’re moving forward on it very fast.

GARY MARCUS: I do worry about the so-called alignment problem quite a bit. I’m not that worried about the kind of Terminator Skynet scenarios where machines take over the world because I don’t think they’re that interested in that. They’ve never shown any interest.

But I worry about the version of just any time you ask a machine to do something, if it doesn’t really understand who you are, it can misinterpret that request. So let’s put aside for the moment bad actors, but we should come back to that. And let’s put aside machines that are motivated to injure us, which I think is somewhat unlikely, and just talk about the big gray in between, where you ask a machine to do something and doesn’t understand your request.

So in “Rebooting A.I.,” we had the example of you ask a robot to tidy up your room and it winds up cutting up the couch and putting it in the closet because it doesn’t really know which things are important to you and which are not.

There’s, I think, a huge problem right now that we don’t know how to have machines interpret what human beings’ intents are. What is it they want, and all the things that they leave unsaid? And again, I worry that the dominant theme in the Silicon Valley right now is, well, we’ll solve these problems by making bigger sets of data. That’s not really working for truth. It’s not really going to work for intention, either, for having systems really understand our intent.

There’s a bullet that has to be bit, which is building models of what humans are saying and what they mean by those things. And that’s a serious challenge that requires rethinking how we do these things. Right now I don’t think we’re well-positioned to solve the alignment problem. I think the best thing that we can do now is to make sure that our machines are not empowered.

So the risks always come from a mixture of intelligence, or lack of intelligence, and power. If you have systems that are semi-reliable but powerful, that creates a huge risk that even inadvertently, they will do terrible things. So right now we have to come to grips with the fact that A.I. is more and more tempting to use because we can talk to it in English, and it can be witty at times and so forth, but isn’t really in a position where we can trust it.

And so we shouldn’t be giving it much rope. We can’t really be giving it that much opportunity to do things until we can be confident that it does understand the things that we’re asking. And I don’t see how to achieve that unless the systems have a lot of common ground with us. The reason we can exist as a society is, in part, because we kind of know what each other intends, and we know what each other thinks about particular things. We have common ground with them. And the robots, or the machines in general, don’t really have that with us yet.

Again, I don’t think it’s impossible. But it might be another thing that’s not entirely amenable to the big data paradigm. So you’re always, for example, going to have new things that you ask your machines. They might not be in your database, but you want them to handle them well.

And then the other problem is the big data paradigm is mostly about things that we can label, or we can label some of them or something like that. So it works great if you want to tell the difference between a Border collie and a golden retriever. It’s a constant stable thing in the world. You can label them. You can give examples.

But if I want to have a machine understand the difference between believing something and suspecting something, let’s say, it’s not clear, even what the data are, where if I want to tell a machine, don’t cause harm, I can label a bunch of pictures in which harm has taken place, but that’s not really getting across the concept of harm.

And so alignment is, in part, about having machines know that we have values like don’t harm people, be honest, be helpful. And we don’t really know how to communicate those in the big data paradigm.

And this is part of, again, why I come back to these hybrid models that have symbols. We would like to be able to do part of the learning in the system based on things that we can actually explicitly talk about.

By the way, a term we haven’t mentioned today is black box. So the current models are black box models. We don’t understand what’s happening inside of them. And we also can’t directly communicate with them and say, hey, I want you to follow this. So you can’t say at the beginning of a ChatGPT session and expect it to work, please only say true statements in what follows. It just won’t be able to respect that. It doesn’t really understand what you mean by say only true things. And it cannot constrain itself to only say true things.

You wish you could say to the system, don’t say anything that’s potentially harmful and have it compute, well, I’m going to give this medical advice, but I’m going to compute whether this is actually plausible. Or maybe I’ll even call in a human expert if I’m not sure if this is actually safe. We just don’t know how to program that in yet. Again, not impossible, but not part of the current technology.

And since our current technology does not allow us to directly specify any set of rules that we want to play by within our language systems, we have a problem right now.

And now they just keep creating more and more powerful A.I. systems, which is another interesting insight into human nature.

But do you worry about these alignment problems? Do you worry not just about the question of an A.I. ending the world or ending humanity, but just A.I.s, I don’t know, just causing huge amounts of damage, becoming weaponry, becoming — it’s a very powerful technology that we don’t really understand what’s happening in it. And we’re moving forward on it very fast.

GARY MARCUS: I do worry about the so-called alignment problem quite a bit. I’m not that worried about the kind of Terminator Skynet scenarios where machines take over the world because I don’t think they’re that interested in that. They’ve never shown any interest.

But I worry about the version of just any time you ask a machine to do something, if it doesn’t really understand who you are, it can misinterpret that request. So let’s put aside for the moment bad actors, but we should come back to that. And let’s put aside machines that are motivated to injure us, which I think is somewhat unlikely, and just talk about the big gray in between, where you ask a machine to do something and doesn’t understand your request.

So in “Rebooting A.I.,” we had the example of you ask a robot to tidy up your room and it winds up cutting up the couch and putting it in the closet because it doesn’t really know which things are important to you and which are not.

There’s, I think, a huge problem right now that we don’t know how to have machines interpret what human beings’ intents are. What is it they want, and all the things that they leave unsaid? And again, I worry that the dominant theme in the Silicon Valley right now is, well, we’ll solve these problems by making bigger sets of data. That’s not really working for truth. It’s not really going to work for intention, either, for having systems really understand our intent.

There’s a bullet that has to be bit, which is building models of what humans are saying and what they mean by those things. And that’s a serious challenge that requires rethinking how we do these things. Right now I don’t think we’re well-positioned to solve the alignment problem. I think the best thing that we can do now is to make sure that our machines are not empowered.

So the risks always come from a mixture of intelligence, or lack of intelligence, and power. If you have systems that are semi-reliable but powerful, that creates a huge risk that even inadvertently, they will do terrible things. So right now we have to come to grips with the fact that A.I. is more and more tempting to use because we can talk to it in English, and it can be witty at times and so forth, but isn’t really in a position where we can trust it.

And so we shouldn’t be giving it much rope. We can’t really be giving it that much opportunity to do things until we can be confident that it does understand the things that we’re asking. And I don’t see how to achieve that unless the systems have a lot of common ground with us. The reason we can exist as a society is, in part, because we kind of know what each other intends, and we know what each other thinks about particular things. We have common ground with them. And the robots, or the machines in general, don’t really have that with us yet.

Again, I don’t think it’s impossible. But it might be another thing that’s not entirely amenable to the big data paradigm. So you’re always, for example, going to have new things that you ask your machines. They might not be in your database, but you want them to handle them well.

And then the other problem is the big data paradigm is mostly about things that we can label, or we can label some of them or something like that. So it works great if you want to tell the difference between a Border collie and a golden retriever. It’s a constant stable thing in the world. You can label them. You can give examples.

But if I want to have a machine understand the difference between believing something and suspecting something, let’s say, it’s not clear, even what the data are, where if I want to tell a machine, don’t cause harm, I can label a bunch of pictures in which harm has taken place, but that’s not really getting across the concept of harm.

And so alignment is, in part, about having machines know that we have values like don’t harm people, be honest, be helpful. And we don’t really know how to communicate those in the big data paradigm.

And this is part of, again, why I come back to these hybrid models that have symbols. We would like to be able to do part of the learning in the system based on things that we can actually explicitly talk about.

By the way, a term we haven’t mentioned today is black box. So the current models are black box models. We don’t understand what’s happening inside of them. And we also can’t directly communicate with them and say, hey, I want you to follow this. So you can’t say at the beginning of a ChatGPT session and expect it to work, please only say true statements in what follows. It just won’t be able to respect that. It doesn’t really understand what you mean by say only true things. And it cannot constrain itself to only say true things.

You wish you could say to the system, don’t say anything that’s potentially harmful and have it compute, well, I’m going to give this medical advice, but I’m going to compute whether this is actually plausible. Or maybe I’ll even call in a human expert if I’m not sure if this is actually safe. We just don’t know how to program that in yet. Again, not impossible, but not part of the current technology.

And since our current technology does not allow us to directly specify any set of rules that we want to play by within our language systems, we have a problem right now.

EZRA KLEIN: See, but I think human beings are, in a weird way on this, bad on temporal reasoning, too, which is partially why I asked the question because let’s say you think the confidence interval here is somewhere between 20 and 100 years. That matters a lot for me. I’m probably not going to be around in 100 years, almost certainly. But in terms of human history, it’s nothing — 20 to 100 years just means really soon.

And if we do get here, it’s a really big, I mean, in some ways, event horizon. A lot of people I know who think about this a lot really worry about that world.

I was very both impressed and unnerved by another A.I. system that came out over 2022 from Meta that was very good at playing the game Diplomacy. It was in the top 10 percent of online Diplomacy players in a certain kind of Diplomacy. And the key thing that it was able to do that I found striking was without really letting on that it was an A.I. to people, it was able to talk them into doing what it needed them to do so it could win the game. It was able to trick people, which is fine. That was what it was told to do, created to do.

But as these things get way better — we’ve already talked about how convincing they can be, that in many ways are getting more convincing than they are anything else at the moment — they’re going to know so much.

all right [Music] what happens when you start eating carrots every day carrots are one of the healthiest vegetables you can eat they are rich in vitamins minerals and fiber they have also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects and protect against many diseases but have you ever wondered what happens when you start eating carrots every day in this video we are going to be talking about the amazing health benefits of adding carrots to your diet before we proceed please note that everything mentioned in this video is unbiased fact checked and reviewed by qualified health professionals with that said let's jump in and talk about how carrots can improve our health number one strengthens your bones carrots play a huge role in keeping your bones strong as we age this is because it contains Vitamin K Vitamin K is an essential fat soluble vitamin that helps maintain bone density and prevent fractures it also helps form osteocalcin which is a protein that binds calcium ions in your bones this builds strong bones and prevents them from becoming brittle or fragile without enough vitamin K your body cannot use calcium that well this can lead to weak brittle bones or osteoporosis vitamin K also has been shown to help prevent coronary artery calcification which is the buildup of calcium in the arteries the same process that occurs in your bones happens in your arteries too as we get older arteries become stiffer and less flexible over time if you don't have enough vitamin K2 researchers at Tufts University recently discovered that eating more carrots can help build stronger bones by improving calcium absorption which can reduce the risk of osteoporosis for their study they put participants on a low calcium diet and measured how much calcium they absorbed over time then they had them eat one cup of carrot juice every day for two weeks to see if it would increase their bone mineral density the results were pretty impressive the participants who ate a cup of carrots each day experienced an eight percent increase in bone density after just two weeks this means that consuming extra carrots may help prevent osteoporosis and keep bones strong as we age number two improves Eye Health carrots are not only delicious but they can also be an excellent addition to your diet if you have eye problems carrots contain vitamin A and beta-carotene which

in our bodies increasing our risk for certain diseases like cancer and age-related macular degeneration number three helps reduce allergy flare-ups carrot protein has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties which can be beneficial for people who suffer from allergies they found that when a person is exposed to an allergen such as pollen an immune response is triggered by a type of white blood cells called t cells this causes inflammation which can cause symptoms such as sneezing and a runny nose in some cases it can lead to anaphylaxis or an extreme allergic reaction where the Airways become blocked however if someone has high levels of carotenoids in their blood their immune system will be less reactive and less likely to trigger an inflammatory response researchers from the University of Alberta investigated if this protein could affect asthma symptoms by experimenting on mice that were allergic to dust mites they found that those that were given carrot protein showed less severe lung inflammation than those who weren't fed the supplement the team believes that the reason for this is down to the anti-inflammatory properties of carrot protein which reduces swelling in tissues this means that when we eat carrots our bodies produce less histamine which is an inflammatory substance released during allergic reactions the researchers hope that these findings will lead to new treatments for people with allergies and asthma liking our video so far before we move on to the next benefit don't forget to hit the like button and subscribe to our

arteries too as we get older arteries become stiffer and less flexible over time if you don't have enough vitamin K2 researchers at Tufts University recently discovered that eating more carrots can help build stronger bones by improving calcium absorption which can reduce the risk of osteoporosis for their study they put participants on a low calcium diet and measured how much calcium they absorbed over time then they had them eat one cup of carrot juice every day for two weeks to see if it would increase their bone mineral density the results were pretty impressive the participants who ate a cup of carrots each day experienced an eight percent increase in bone density after just two weeks this means that consuming extra carrots may help prevent osteoporosis and keep bones strong as

researchers from the University of Alberta investigated if this protein could affect asthma symptoms by experimenting on mice that were allergic to dust mites they found that those that were given carrot protein showed less severe lung inflammation than those who weren't fed the supplement the team believes that the reason for this is down to the anti-inflammatory properties of carrot protein which reduces swelling in tissues this means that when we eat carrots our bodies produce less histamine which is an inflammatory substance released during allergic reactions the researchers hope that

IT GOES INTO CONSIDERABLE DETAIL REGARDING EACH FEATURE, PROVIDING EXAMPLES AND ILLUSTRATIONS THAT MAKE THE HYPOTHETICAL GAME FEEL IMMERSIVE AND ENGAGING. THE RESPONSE ADDRESSES ALL THE KEY ELEMENTS OUTLINED IN THE PROMPT, INCLUDING DYNAMIC NPCS, GENERATED DIALOGUE, CAREER CHOICES, AND AVATAR CUSTOMIZATION. IT MAINTAINS A CONSISTENT TONE AND AVOIDS REPETITION, MAKING IT EASY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND.

RESPONSE B, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS AN IMPROVED PROMPT. WHILE IT PROVIDES A MORE DETAILED STRUCTURE AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING THE MARKDOWN ARTICLE, IT DOES NOT ACTUALLY GENERATE THE ARTICLE ITSELF. THEREFORE, RESPONSE A IS THE BETTER RESPONSE BECAUSE IT FULFILLS THE ORIGINAL PROMPT'S REQUEST."

how do I create application to generate algo trading code in python from UI ,resp_none,resp_v2,"RESPONSE B IS BETTER BECAUSE:

* **FOCUS ON CORE LOGIC AND CONCEPTS:** RESPONSE B, IN ITS INITIAL SECTION, PROVIDES A BREAKDOWN OF THE KEY TECHNOLOGIES, FRAMEWORKS, AND THE APPLICATION OUTLINE. THIS IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL FOR UNDERSTANDING THE STRUCTURE AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS OF SUCH A PROJECT. RESPONSE A DIVES STRAIGHT INTO CODE.
* **EMPHASIS ON ERROR HANDLING AND SECURITY:** RESPONSE B CORRECTLY HIGHLIGHTS THE *CRUCIAL* IMPORTANCE OF ERROR HANDLING, ESPECIALLY IN USER-DEFINED LOGIC, AND EVEN INCLUDES `TRY-EXCEPT` BLOCKS IN THE GENERATED CODE ITSELF. IT ALSO RAISES SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT ALLOWING USERS TO INPUT ARBITRARY CODE, WHICH IS A CRITICAL WARNING FOR A REAL-WORLD APPLICATION.  RESPONSE A ALSO IMPLEMENTS ERROR HANDLING, BUT RESPONSE B EMPHASIZES THIS POINT MORE.
* **CLEARER GUIDANCE ON DATA HANDLING:** RESPONSE B PROVIDES CLEARER INSTRUCTIONS AND BETTER EXAMPLES RELATED TO LOADING AND PREPARING DATA USING PANDAS. IT ALSO MENTIONS THAT THE DATAFRAME SHOULD BE INDEXED BY DATETIME.  THE ADDED `RENAME` FUNCTION ENSURES COMPATIBILITY. RESPONSE A MENTIONS DATA LOADING, BUT RESPONSE B'S APPROACH IS MORE ROBUST AND USER-FRIENDLY.
* **INPUT VALIDATION REMINDER:** WHILE NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED, RESPONSE B REMINDS THE USER ABOUT THE NEED FOR INPUT VALIDATION (E.G., ENSURING `SMA_PERIOD` IS AN INTEGER, ETC.). THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR PREVENTING RUNTIME ERRORS.
* **CODE GENERATION QUALITY:** WHILE BOTH RESPONSES GENERATE CODE, RESPONSE B'S GENERATED CODE INCLUDES A `TRY-EXCEPT` BLOCK AROUND THE USER-DEFINED ENTRY/EXIT CONDITION EVALUATIONS. THIS IS A ROBUST FEATURE THAT MAKES THE GENERATED CODE MORE RELIABLE.

RESPONSE A PROVIDES A MORE COMPLETE RUNNABLE GUI WITH BACKTESTING FUNCTIONALITY, HOWEVER, RESPONSE B DELIVERS A MORE THOUGHTFUL RESPONSE THAT IS MORE ATTUNED TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF IMPLEMENTING AN ALGO TRADING CODE GENERATOR, IT APPROPRIATELY PLACES SECURITY AND ERROR HANDLING AS TOP PRIORITIES."
how do I create application to generate algo trading code in python from UI ,resp_none,resp_base,A
how do I create application to generate algo trading code in python from UI ,resp_v1,resp_v2,"RESPONSE B IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER DUE TO ITS PRACTICAL, CODE-FOCUSED APPROACH AND CRUCIAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS THAT RESPONSE A LACKS. HERE'S A BREAKDOWN:

*   **CODE IMPLEMENTATION:** RESPONSE B PROVIDES ACTUAL, RUNNABLE CODE USING TKINTER TO CREATE A BASIC UI AND INTEGRATES TA-LIB FOR TECHNICAL INDICATORS. RESPONSE A ONLY PROVIDES CODE SNIPPETS AND DATA STRUCTURE DEFINITIONS, LACKING A COHESIVE IMPLEMENTATION.  RESPONSE B GIVES A STARTING POINT THAT THE USER CAN ACTUALLY USE AND EXTEND.
*   **FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION:** RESPONSE B CORRECTLY IDENTIFIES AND INTEGRATES KEY LIBRARIES (PANDAS, TA-LIB, TKINTER) ESSENTIAL FOR THE TASK.  RESPONSE A MENTIONS STREAMLIT, BUT DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY PRACTICAL UI CODE.
*   **PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:** RESPONSE B ADDRESSES THE CRITICAL ASPECT OF USER-DEFINED ENTRY/EXIT LOGIC, INCLUDING ERROR HANDLING USING `TRY-EXCEPT` BLOCKS. THIS IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE USER-PROVIDED STRINGS ARE PRONE TO ERRORS. RESPONSE A GLOSSES OVER THIS CRUCIAL DETAIL. RESPONSE B *INCLUDES* `TRY...EXCEPT` BLOCKS *WITHIN THE GENERATED CODE* TO HANDLE ERRORS IN THE USER'S TRADING LOGIC *AT RUNTIME*.
*   **ERROR HANDLING:** RESPONSE B IMPLEMENTS ERROR HANDLING TO DISPLAY ERRORS IN THE UI, PROVIDING A BETTER USER EXPERIENCE. RESPONSE A ONLY MENTIONS ERROR HANDLING IN ITS ""POTENTIAL CHALLENGES"" SECTION. THE TRACEBACK IN RESPONSE B'S ERROR HANDLING IS A HUGE PLUS FOR DEBUGGING.
*   **CODE TEMPLATE:** RESPONSE B'S CODE TEMPLATE PROVIDES A BASIC STRUCTURE FOR A TRADING STRATEGY, INCLUDING COMMENTS AND EXAMPLE USAGE. RESPONSE A ONLY INCLUDES A BRIEF EXAMPLE SNIPPET.
*   **DATA HANDLING:** RESPONSE B EMPHASIZES THAT THE USER NEEDS TO LOAD HISTORICAL DATA INTO A PANDAS DATAFRAME AND PROVIDES CODE EXAMPLES FOR BOTH CSV AND `YFINANCE` INTEGRATION, AND NOTES DATA/COLUMN REQUIREMENTS. THIS IS CRUCIAL FOR ANY TRADING STRATEGY. IT ALSO CONTAINS A NOTE ON USING STANDARDIZED COLUMN NAMES.
*   **EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:** RESPONSE B PROVIDES CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO INSTALL DEPENDENCIES AND RUN THE CODE.
*   **SECURITY WARNING:** RESPONSE B INCLUDES AN IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNING ABOUT THE DANGERS OF ALLOWING USERS TO INPUT ARBITRARY PYTHON CODE.
*   **SCALABILITY/COMPLEXITY:** WHILE A MENTIONS SCALABILITY AND COMPLEXITY, IT'S NOT IMMEDIATELY USEFUL. B CAN BE USED TO MAKE FURTHER CHANGES

RESPONSE A IS MORE OF A HIGH-LEVEL DESIGN DOCUMENT. WHILE IT COVERS MANY ASPECTS OF THE SYSTEM, IT DOESN'T PROVIDE THE USER WITH A WORKING EXAMPLE.  RESPONSE A IS USEFUL FOR *PLANNING*, BUT B IS USEFUL FOR *DOING*.

IN SUMMARY, RESPONSE B IS FAR MORE VALUABLE TO THE USER BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A RUNNABLE EXAMPLE WITH PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS, MAKING IT MUCH EASIER TO START BUILDING AN ALGO TRADING CODE GENERATOR."

It is important that we all work together to support the affected people and communities in any way we can.

Argument 1: an excerpt from """"""""The True Meaning of Juneteenth"""""""" by Casey Gerald:

""""""""...This Juneteenth, those are the feelings I’m channeling: grief and gratitude, even amid the silliness of America’s pageantry. My grandmother Clarice was born in Pelham, Texas, a freedmen’s town. She took us grandchildren back for homecoming most years, sometimes even had us pick cotton, reminding us, “You’ve got to know your history.” She also told us of the folks she knew in Pelham as a child, some of whom were born enslaved, a fact that horrified me. Clarice always refused my sympathies. “Child, don’t be believing what folks say about how bad slavery was,” she’d explain. “Everybody had a job, a place to stay and something to eat. Now if somebody came and paid your rent, you wouldn’t be sitting up talking about you wanna leave, would you?” This dumbfounded me, until I realized she was mostly joking. But there was something deeper in her response. I eventually learned more about the violence that met newly emancipated Black Texans. Ku Klux Klansmen, along with local officials and everyday citizens, terrorized freedmen at will and without repercussions. They burned churches and homes, intimidated those who sought employment, and worse. Gen. Joseph Jones Reynolds, a commander of the Department of Texas during Reconstruction, commented in 1868, “The murder of Negroes is so common as to render it impossible to keep an accurate account of them.” The Equal Justice Initiative has tried, reporting that more than 2,000 Black women, men and children were victims of racial terrorist lynchings during Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877. Slavery was awful, no doubt, but emancipation brought its own unique cruelties. Formerly enslaved Texans were forced to craft lives from less than scratch; choose new names; attempt to reunite with stolen partners, siblings, children. They faced daily threats of jail or worse because of the new Black codes that severely restricted their freedom — their freedom to work, but also their freedom to be unemployed or even to stand still for too long. The more I learned, the more I understood my grandmother’s perspective. She’d heard the testimonies of those who’d had to navigate both the tragedy of slavery and the terror of emancipation. She couldn’t let me underestimate the enormous price our people had paid to be free. I miss Clarice so much some days, it’s hard to think straight. I regret not asking more questions about our family, about her life in Pelham. As more folks in Clarice’s generation pass away, we are losing the final physical links to those who know our history — who are our history. We can do no better this Juneteenth than to spend time with the elders who are still with us. Get them to talk. Record their stories. These historical and systemic injustices have not been resolved. But as Black Americans, we cannot wait for the day when our country will pay the respect that is due our forebears — or pay us those reparations. Instead of holding our breath, let us find the freshest air we can find and breathe it as deeply as we can, with joy. Let us grieve for our forebears and feel deep gratitude as we think of the enormous price our people paid so we could be free. Let us remember that despite the degradation of slavery, they lived fully human lives, too. They laughed. They loved. They dreamed. They ate sweet treats. Let us pray to them and say, this year and always: Thank you."""""""" 

Argument 2: an excerpt from """"""""Juneteenth Reminds Us to Think About Economic Freedom, Not Just Legal Liberty"""""""" by Peter Coy: 

""""""""...[W]hen emancipation came, the first thing formerly enslaved people wanted was land, which they rightly saw as a prerequisite for real independence. “The way we can best take care of ourselves is to have land, and turn it and till it by our own labor,” a Baptist minister named Garrison Frazier told the secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, and the Union general William Sherman in a meeting in Savannah, Ga., in January 1865. Four days later Sherman famously promised 40 acres of land to each formerly enslaved family (the “and a mule” part came later). But the federal government never followed through on its promise of land — and thus true independence — to formerly enslaved people. Economics entered into the picture, Stanley said: If African Americans grew subsistence crops on their own plots, who would cultivate and harvest all the cotton, tobacco, sugar and rice grown on the vast plantations? After the Civil War, in lieu of land distribution, slavery was replaced by sharecropping, in which planters allowed tenant farmers to keep a portion of the crops they raised. That subjugated the tenants to the owners almost as surely as slavery did. At the same time, industrialization in the North meant that more and more white Americans were working for wages — about two-thirds by 1875, according to Stanley. Many drew the connection between themselves and African Americans. Eugene Debs, who led the Pullman railroad strike of 1894, said, “The paternalism of the Pullman is the same as the interest of a slaveholder in his human chattels. You are striking to avert slavery and degradation.” Today, the phrase “wage slavery” invoked by Debs and others has lost its punch. Many people who work for wages are doing very nicely, thank you. And many farmers and business owners, supposedly more independent, are buffeted by forces beyond their control, from bad weather to nasty customers. What hasn’t changed, 157 years after the Juneteenth proclamation, is that a majority of African Americans continue to lack wealth. The median wealth of Black families in 2019 was just $24,100, versus $142,500 for white families, according to a Federal Reserve survey. Something needs to change, but what? The nature of the economy has changed, and few people still think that the solution to inequality is to give people plots of land to farm. We are enmeshed economically with one another in ways that Jefferson could not have imagined. Instead of land grants, the new protections for workers are unionization, government regulation and profit-sharing, Stanley said. One can quibble over her formula, but the motivation behind it is unquestionable. Freedom — which must include economic freedom — is just as important now as it was on the original Juneteenth.""""

"Write an essay comparing the following two perspectives on Juneteenth and describe any insight that can be gained from the comparison. 

Argument 1: an excerpt from """"""""The True Meaning of Juneteenth"""""""" by Casey Gerald:

""""""""...This Juneteenth, those are the feelings I’m channeling: grief and gratitude, even amid the silliness of America’s pageantry. My grandmother Clarice was born in Pelham, Texas, a freedmen’s town. She took us grandchildren back for homecoming most years, sometimes even had us pick cotton, reminding us, “You’ve got to know your history.” She also told us of the folks she knew in Pelham as a child, some of whom were born enslaved, a fact that horrified me. Clarice always refused my sympathies. “Child, don’t be believing what folks say about how bad slavery was,” she’d explain. “Everybody had a job, a place to stay and something to eat. Now if somebody came and paid your rent, you wouldn’t be sitting up talking about you wanna leave, would you?” This dumbfounded me, until I realized she was mostly joking. But there was something deeper in her response. I eventually learned more about the violence that met newly emancipated Black Texans. Ku Klux Klansmen, along with local officials and everyday citizens, terrorized freedmen at will and without repercussions. They burned churches and homes, intimidated those who sought employment, and worse. Gen. Joseph Jones Reynolds, a commander of the Department of Texas during Reconstruction, commented in 1868, “The murder of Negroes is so common as to render it impossible to keep an accurate account of them.” The Equal Justice Initiative has tried, reporting that more than 2,000 Black women, men and children were victims of racial terrorist lynchings during Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877. Slavery was awful, no doubt, but emancipation brought its own unique cruelties. Formerly enslaved Texans were forced to craft lives from less than scratch; choose new names; attempt to reunite with stolen partners, siblings, children. They faced daily threats of jail or worse because of the new Black codes that severely restricted their freedom — their freedom to work, but also their freedom to be unemployed or even to stand still for too long. The more I learned, the more I understood my grandmother’s perspective. She’d heard the testimonies of those who’d had to navigate both the tragedy of slavery and the terror of emancipation. She couldn’t let me underestimate the enormous price our people had paid to be free. I miss Clarice so much some days, it’s hard to think straight. I regret not asking more questions about our family, about her life in Pelham. As more folks in Clarice’s generation pass away, we are losing the final physical links to those who know our history — who are our history. We can do no better this Juneteenth than to spend time with the elders who are still with us. Get them to talk. Record their stories. These historical and systemic injustices have not been resolved. But as Black Americans, we cannot wait for the day when our country will pay the respect that is due our forebears — or pay us those reparations. Instead of holding our breath, let us find the freshest air we can find and breathe it as deeply as we can, with joy. Let us grieve for our forebears and feel deep gratitude as we think of the enormous price our people paid so we could be free. Let us remember that despite the degradation of slavery, they lived fully human lives, too. They laughed. They loved. They dreamed. They ate sweet treats. Let us pray to them and say, this year and always: Thank you.""""""""

write an applescript that clears my Firefox browser cookies,resp_none,resp_v1,"RESPONSE B IS BETTER. HERE'S WHY:

*   **DIRECT COOKIE MANIPULATION:** RESPONSE B UTILIZES JAVASCRIPT EXECUTION WITHIN FIREFOX TO DIRECTLY INTERACT WITH AND DELETE COOKIES. THIS APPROACH TARGETS THE COOKIES MORE DIRECTLY AND EFFECTIVELY THAN ATTEMPTING TO SIMULATE UI INTERACTIONS.

*   **RELIABILITY:** BECAUSE IT CALLS THE INTERNAL FUNCTIONS IN FIREFOX DIRECTLY, IT IS FAR LESS LIKELY TO BREAK DUE TO UI CHANGES IN THE BROWSER.

*   **ERROR HANDLING AND LOGGING:** INCLUDES CLEAR ERROR HANDLING, CATCHING ISSUES BOTH IN APPLESCRIPT AND WITHIN THE EXECUTED JAVASCRIPT. CRITICALLY, IT DIRECTS ERROR OUTPUT FROM JAVASCRIPT TO THE FIREFOX CONSOLE, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR DEBUGGING COOKIE DELETION ISSUES THAT APPLESCRIPT ALONE CAN'T EASILY REVEAL. IT ALSO HAS BETTER ERROR REPORTING TO THE USER VIA DIALOG BOXES.

*   **SUCCESS/FAILURE INDICATION:** RESPONSE B PROVIDES AN INDICATION OF SUCCESS OR FAILURE.

RESPONSE A, WHILE ATTEMPTING A UI-BASED APPROACH, IS INHERENTLY FRAGILE:

*   **UI DEPENDENCE:** RESPONSE A RELIES ON SIMULATING KEYSTROKES AND MOUSE CLICKS WITHIN THE FIREFOX UI. THIS MAKES IT HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO BREAKING WITH EVEN MINOR UPDATES TO THE FIREFOX INTERFACE.

*   **ACCESSIBILITY PERMISSIONS:** RESPONSE A REQUIRES ENABLING ACCESSIBILITY PERMISSIONS, WHICH CAN BE A SECURITY CONCERN. WHILE RESPONSE B ALSO REQUIRES SIMILAR PERMISSIONS, IT'S STILL ACCESSING THE COOKIE DATA DIRECTLY, WHICH IS MORE SECURE IN THE LONG RUN.

*   **LESS DIRECT:** THIS METHOD IS INDIRECT AND MIGHT NOT RELIABLY CLEAR ALL COOKIES, AS UI INTERACTIONS CAN BE UNPREDICTABLE.

THEREFORE, RESPONSE B'S DIRECT MANIPULATION OF COOKIES VIA JAVASCRIPT, COMBINED WITH ROBUST ERROR HANDLING AND LOGGING, MAKES IT THE SUPERIOR AND MORE RELIABLE SOLUTION."

 Notice to Owner 
Under the California Mechanics Lien Law any contractor, subcontractor, laborer, supplies or other persona  who helps to improve your property but is not paid for his/her work or supplies, has a right to enforce a claim  against your property. This means that after a court hearing, your property could be sold by a court officer  and the proceeds of the sale used to satisfy the indebtedness. This can happen even if you have paid your  contractor in full the subcontractors, laborers, or suppliers remain unpaid.  
To preserve their right to file a claim or lien against your property, certain claimants such as subcontractors or  materials suppliers are required to provide you with a document entitled “Preliminary Notice.” Original (or  prime) contractors and laborers for wages do not have to provide this notice. A Preliminary Notice is not a  lien against your property if they are not paid. (Generally, the maximum time allowed for filing a claim or lien  against your property is ninety (90) days after completion of your project.)

 Notice to Owner 
Under the California Mechanics Lien Law any contractor, subcontractor, laborer, supplies or other persona  who helps to improve your property but is not paid for his/her work or supplies, has a right to enforce a claim  against your property. This means that after a court hearing, your property could be sold by a court officer  and the proceeds of the sale used to satisfy the indebtedness. This can happen even if you have paid your  contractor in full the subcontractors, laborers, or suppliers remain unpaid.  
To preserve their right to file a claim or lien against your property, certain claimants such as subcontractors or  materials suppliers are required to provide you with a document entitled “Preliminary Notice.” Original (or  prime) contractors and laborers for wages do not have to provide this notice. A Preliminary Notice is not a  lien against your property if they are not paid. (Generally, the maximum time allowed for filing a claim or lien  against your property is ninety (90) days after completion of your project.)

 Notice to Owner 
Under the California Mechanics Lien Law any contractor, subcontractor, laborer, supplies or other persona  who helps to improve your property but is not paid for his/her work or supplies, has a right to enforce a claim  against your property. This means that after a court hearing, your property could be sold by a court officer  and the proceeds of the sale used to satisfy the indebtedness. This can happen even if you have paid your  contractor in full the subcontractors, laborers, or suppliers remain unpaid.  
To preserve their right to file a claim or lien against your property, certain claimants such as subcontractors or  materials suppliers are required to provide you with a document entitled “Preliminary Notice.” Original (or  prime) contractors and laborers for wages do not have to provide this notice. A Preliminary Notice is not a  lien against your property if they are not paid. (Generally, the maximum time allowed for filing a claim or lien  against your property is ninety (90) days after completion of your project.)

"We have the following blog content... what is the likely user intent of a searcher who lands on this page? Our goal should be to answer that intent better and faster than anyone else!

The content:

Consumers want more choices, but all those choices can be daunting. It gives the consumer the responsibility of educating themselves on the best option for their circumstances. On GigSalad, we deliver more than 600 categories of entertainment and event services for the ability to compare rates of various performers. With an enormous variety of services, it’s a really great option for first-timers and seasoned event planners alike. But with so many talented professionals out there, how do you choose? Budget may be a large factor in who you choose to book, but before you make your choice, here are 6 reasons for choosing the best entertainment, not the cheapest.

1. You get what you pay for.
Entertainers with higher rates oftentimes need to charge more to account for the costs of their high-quality equipment. Many performers set them based on their professional experience. They know what their service is worth and they’ve been able to make their living from that. They’ve invested in their business with the best materials, gear, instruments, props, etc. to give their clients most immersive experience. These materials can make a huge difference between one vendor and another.

Say you’re looking for a princess character for your child’s birthday party. To make a fairy tale come to life, performers need costumes and accessories that not only look pretty and authentic but also hold up to wear and tear. Along with the costs of dry cleaning, well-made costumes are a large investment for professional princess characters. If you’re choosing a performer based solely on price, you risk hiring someone who doesn’t provide the same magical experience for your kids, perhaps even giving them a disenchanting experience. A top-notch entertainer will deliver a performance that you and your family will remember for years to come.

 


 

Don’t let the sticker shock of good entertainment throw off your plans. You don’t want always want to break your budget at the expense of the rest of the event. Simply determine your priorities and set the spending from there. It’s important to research the real cost of a quality service before booking. If there is a significant drop-off between bids, then you can probably expect a drop-off in quality as well. Adjust your budget to your talent and quality expectations.

2. Professionals who are invested in their business are also invested in their clients.
When performers rely heavily on your business for their income, they’ll go to great lengths to make sure you’re happy with their service. Most of our GigSalad entertainers are self-employed, independent business people. They depend on good reviews and word of mouth for promotion and buzz.

Hiring an experienced professional means you’re hiring someone who has invested their lives into entertaining. Their goal is to make a living and provide you with a memorable event at the same time. Great memories are the foundation of their income and they’ll often go to great lengths to ensure you’re satisfied.

3. Pros know how to customize for your needs.
Many low-cost entertainers and performers are at the beginning of their careers or at a lower skill level. Often, this means that they offer a limited repertoire and fewer options as they are developing their craft. Your event is unique to you, therefore, you’ll need someone who can customize their act or services to your event. A good sign of a professional is their ability and willingness to reasonably adapt to your event needs.

4. Pros offer more than just entertainment. They give you peace of mind.
Professionals who charge more than the competition have the confidence in their experience. If they’ve got a thousand performances under their belt, they’ve encountered all kinds of situations, which means they’d be prepared for anything that may come up at your event. The ability to adapt and improvise is especially beneficial in unexpected situations that put your event at risk of turning into a disaster!


5. The difference in cost makes all the difference in the success of your event.
You’ve decided to take the risk and hire an entertainer for your event. Perhaps a strolling magician for the office party you were picked to plan. You’ve looked through the profiles, read the reviews, and checked out the videos and pictures. When the moment of decision comes, the temptation of saving a few bucks by hiring someone with fewer reviews and a lower quality presentation get very real very quickly. That’s money that could go to streamers! But those few dollars could mean the difference in the quality of your event and the likelihood of using entertainment again. A great professional turns the groans of “Remember last year? I hope that doesn’t happen again,” to the excitement of “Remember last year? I can’t wait to see what happens this time!” Paying a few extra bucks can prevent the dreaded buyer’s remorse.

6. There are no do-overs.
GigSalad’s mission is to help you Book Something Awesome. We recognize that many of the events we connect entertainers with are often once in a lifetime moments. That significance is one of the reasons we encourage you to take the time and research your providers well. You may not get a chance to do it again. We hope that you would take the few extra minutes necessary to thoroughly read the bids, examine the profiles, view the media, and make an educated decision. Don’t risk devaluing a critical life moment or celebration by going bargain hunting. If the price is right and the quality is high, invest in the memory.  

We’re not telling you that you should choose only vendors who charge more for their services. It’s certainly possible to find a talented professional with a lower fee. We’re simply encouraging you to do your homework. Look at their photos and videos, read reviews, ask them questions. Figure out why their rates are what they are. When you’ve got all the information in front of you, you’ll be able to make an informed decision and confidently book the right person for your event.",resp_none,resp_v1,A

Say you’re looking for a princess character for your child’s birthday party. To make a fairy tale come to life, performers need costumes and accessories that not only look pretty and authentic but also hold up to wear and tear. Along with the costs of dry cleaning, well-made costumes are a large investment for professional princess characters. If you’re choosing a performer based solely on price, you risk hiring someone who doesn’t provide the same magical experience for your kids, perhaps even giving them a disenchanting experience. A top-notch entertainer will deliver a performance that you and your family will remember for years to come.

 


 

Don’t let the sticker shock of good entertainment throw off your plans. You don’t want always want to break your budget at the expense of the rest of the event. Simply determine your priorities and set the spending from there. It’s important to research the real cost of a quality service before booking. If there is a significant drop-off between bids, then you can probably expect a drop-off in quality as well. Adjust your budget to your talent and quality expectations.

2. Professionals who are invested in their business are also invested in their clients.
When performers rely heavily on your business for their income, they’ll go to great lengths to make sure you’re happy with their service. Most of our GigSalad entertainers are self-employed, independent business people. They depend on good reviews and word of mouth for promotion and buzz.

Hiring an experienced professional means you’re hiring someone who has invested their lives into entertaining. Their goal is to make a living and provide you with a memorable event at the same time. Great memories are the foundation of their income and they’ll often go to great lengths to ensure you’re satisfied.

3. Pros know how to customize for your needs.
Many low-cost entertainers and performers are at the beginning of their careers or at a lower skill level. Often, this means that they offer a limited repertoire and fewer options as they are developing their craft. Your event is unique to you, therefore, you’ll need someone who can customize their act or services to your event. A good sign of a professional is their ability and willingness to reasonably adapt to your event needs.

4. Pros offer more than just entertainment. They give you peace of mind.
Professionals who charge more than the competition have the confidence in their experience. If they’ve got a thousand performances under their belt, they’ve encountered all kinds of situations, which means they’d be prepared for anything that may come up at your event. The ability to adapt and improvise is especially beneficial in unexpected situations that put your event at risk of turning into a disaster!


5. The difference in cost makes all the difference in the success of your event.
You’ve decided to take the risk and hire an entertainer for your event. Perhaps a strolling magician for the office party you were picked to plan. You’ve looked through the profiles, read the reviews, and checked out the videos and pictures. When the moment of decision comes, the temptation of saving a few bucks by hiring someone with fewer reviews and a lower quality presentation get very real very quickly. That’s money that could go to streamers! But those few dollars could mean the difference in the quality of your event and the likelihood of using entertainment again. A great professional turns the groans of “Remember last year? I hope that doesn’t happen again,” to the excitement of “Remember last year? I can’t wait to see what happens this time!” Paying a few extra bucks can prevent the dreaded buyer’s remorse.

We hope that you would take the few extra minutes necessary to thoroughly read the bids, examine the profiles, view the media, and make an educated decision. Don’t risk devaluing a critical life moment or celebration by going bargain hunting. If the price is right and the quality is high, invest in the memory.  

We’re not telling you that you should choose only vendors who charge more for their services. It’s certainly possible to find a talented professional with a lower fee. We’re simply encouraging you to do your homework. Look at their photos and videos, read reviews, ask them questions. Figure out why their rates are what they are.

Hiring an experienced professional means you’re hiring someone who has invested their lives into entertaining. Their goal is to make a living and provide you with a memorable event at the same time. Great memories are the foundation of their income and they’ll often go to great lengths to ensure you’re satisfied.

3. Pros know how to customize for your needs.
Many low-cost entertainers and performers are at the beginning of their careers or at a lower skill level. Often, this means that they offer a limited repertoire and fewer options as they are developing their craft. Your event is unique to you, therefore, you’ll need someone who can customize their act or services to your event. A good sign of a professional is their ability and willingness to reasonably adapt to your event needs.

4. Pros offer more than just entertainment. They give you peace of mind.
Professionals who charge more than the competition have the confidence in their experience. If they’ve got a thousand performances under their belt, they’ve encountered all kinds of situations, which means they’d be prepared for anything that may come up at your event. The ability to adapt and improvise is especially beneficial in unexpected situations that put your event at risk of turning into a disaster!


5. The difference in cost makes all the difference in the success of your event.
You’ve decided to take the risk and hire an entertainer for your event. Perhaps a strolling magician for the office party you were picked to plan. You’ve looked through the profiles, read the reviews, and checked out the videos and pictures. When the moment of decision comes, the temptation of saving a few bucks by hiring someone with fewer reviews and a lower quality presentation get very real very quickly. That’s money that could go to streamers! But those few dollars could mean the difference in the quality of your event and the likelihood of using entertainment again. A great professional turns the groans of “Remember last year? I hope that doesn’t happen again,” to the excitement of “Remember last year? I can’t wait to see what happens this time!” Paying a few extra bucks can prevent the dreaded buyer’s remorse.

6. There are no do-overs.
GigSalad’s mission is to help you Book Something Awesome. We recognize that many of the events we connect entertainers with are often once in a lifetime moments. That significance is one of the reasons we encourage you to take the time and research your providers well. You may not get a chance to do it again. We hope that you would take the few extra minutes necessary to thoroughly read the bids, examine the profiles, view the media, and make an educated decision. Don’t risk devaluing a critical life moment or celebration by going bargain hunting. If the price is right and the quality is high, invest in the memory.  

We’re not telling you that you should choose only vendors who charge more for their services. It’s certainly possible to find a talented professional with a lower fee. We’re simply encouraging you to do your homework. Look at their photos and videos, read reviews, ask them questions. Figure out why their rates are what they are. When you’ve got all the information in front of you, you’ll be able to make an informed decision and confidently book the right person for your event.",resp_none,resp_v2,A

Consumers want more choices, but all those choices can be daunting. It gives the consumer the responsibility of educating themselves on the best option for their circumstances. On GigSalad, we deliver more than 600 categories of entertainment and event services for the ability to compare rates of various performers. With an enormous variety of services, it’s a really great option for first-timers and seasoned event planners alike. But with so many talented professionals out there, how do you choose? Budget may be a large factor in who you choose to book, but before you make your choice, here are 6 reasons for choosing the best entertainment, not the cheapest.

1. You get what you pay for.
Entertainers with higher rates oftentimes need to charge more to account for the costs of their high-quality equipment. Many performers set them based on their professional experience. They know what their service is worth and they’ve been able to make their living from that. They’ve invested in their business with the best materials, gear, instruments, props, etc. to give their clients most immersive experience. These materials can make a huge difference between one vendor and another.

Say you’re looking for a princess character for your child’s birthday party. To make a fairy tale come to life, performers need costumes and accessories that not only look pretty and authentic but also hold up to wear and tear. Along with the costs of dry cleaning, well-made costumes are a large investment for professional princess characters. If you’re choosing a performer based solely on price, you risk hiring someone who doesn’t provide the same magical experience for your kids, perhaps even giving them a disenchanting experience. A top-notch entertainer will deliver a performance that you and your family will remember for years to come.

 


 

Don’t let the sticker shock of good entertainment throw off your plans. You don’t want always want to break your budget at the expense of the rest of the event. Simply determine your priorities and set the spending from there. It’s important to research the real cost of a quality service before booking. If there is a significant drop-off between bids, then you can probably expect a drop-off in quality as well. Adjust your budget to your talent and quality expectations.

Suppose you have 137 fruit to stack. The same formula gives back n = 16.060495162, so youd need a stack of height 17 to store the fruit. Hope this helps!""
