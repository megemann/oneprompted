"""Quantum Spirit: The Chakra Journey"" is an interactive text-based game that follows the story of Aya, a spiritual warrior chosen by the Quantum Guardian to save the multiverse from destruction. The game is set in a world inspired by tantric Buddhism, where players must journey through seven different realms, each representing one of the seven chakras or states of consciousness.

The game begins with Aya receiving a vision of a dark force that threatens to unravel the fabric of reality. She is tasked by the Quantum Guardian to journey through the seven realms, each representing a different chakra, in order to stop the impending catastrophe.

The first realm is the Muladhara, or the root chakra, which represents the foundation of physical and spiritual existence. This realm is characterized by dense forests, rugged mountains, and ancient ruins, where Aya must confront primal fears and overcome obstacles that block her path.

The second realm is the Svadhishthana, or the sacral chakra, which represents emotions and sexuality. This realm is characterized by lush jungles, sparkling waterfalls, and sensual temples, where Aya must confront her desires and overcome obstacles that block her emotional growth.

The third realm is the Manipura, or the solar plexus chakra, which represents willpower and self-esteem. This realm is characterized by fiery deserts, towering volcanoes, and powerful citadels, where Aya must confront her ego and overcome obstacles that block her willpower.

The fourth realm is the Anahata, or the heart chakra, which represents love and compassion. This realm is characterized by serene gardens, tranquil lakes, and radiant temples, where Aya must confront her love and overcome obstacles that block her compassion.

The fifth realm is the Vishuddha, or the throat chakra, which represents communication and self-expression. This realm is characterized by misty mountains, hidden caves, and mysterious temples, where Aya must confront her voice and overcome obstacles that block her self-expression.

The sixth realm is the Ajna, or the third eye chakra, which represents intuition and wisdom. This realm is characterized by dark forests, mysterious swamps, and ancient ruins, where Aya must confront her intuition and overcome obstacles that block her wisdom.

The seventh realm is the Sahasrara, or the crown chakra, which represents enlightenment and spiritual connection. This realm is characterized by ethereal clouds, radiant light, and transcendent temples, where Aya must confront her enlightenment and overcome obstacles that block her spiritual connection.

As Aya progresses through each realm, she will encounter various allies and enemies, each with their own unique abilities and stories. She will also learn about the interconnectedness of all things and the role that she plays in the grand scheme of the universe. She will discover the truth about her past and her destiny, and will be faced with difficult choices that will determine the fate of the multiverse.

The game will include multiple choices that will affect the outcome of the story, giving players a sense of agency and allowing them to make decisions that will shape their own unique experience.

The art style of the game is inspired by traditional tantric art and the levels are designed to be immersive and engaging, challenging players both physically and mentally, and encouraging them to explore and experiment with different chakras. The interconnected levels, diverse enemies, and challenging puzzles all combine to create a unique and memorable gaming experience.

""Quantum Spirit: The Chakra Journey"" is a unique and innovative take on the interactive text-based game genre, incorporating complex elements of spirituality and quantum physics in a way that challenges and immerses players in a unique and memorable gaming

"2 / 2Great salespeople adopt the same behavior patterns to overcome objections.
It’s like they intuitively know: 1. what each objection really means, and 2. how to get past them.

While it's true that successful salespeople often have a deep understanding of common objections and know how to effectively respond to them, it's important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to overcoming objections. Every potential customer and every objection is unique, so the best salespeople are able to adapt their approach to the specific situation at hand. In general, though, there are some common strategies that successful salespeople use to overcome objections. These include:

Listening carefully to the customer's objection and trying to understand their perspective. This allows the salesperson to address the underlying concern and tailor their response accordingly.
Restating the customer's objection in their own words to confirm that they understand it, and to show the customer that they are listening and taking their concerns seriously.
Responding to the objection with a well-prepared, logical and compelling argument that addresses the customer's concern and highlights the benefits of the product or service being offered.
Offering additional information or resources that can help the customer make an informed decision. This might include customer testimonials, case studies, or third-party reviews.
Asking open-ended questions that encourage the customer to think about the problem in a new way and consider the potential benefits of the product or service.
Offering to address the customer's concern directly with a supervisor or other member of the sales team who has the knowledge and expertise to provide a more detailed response.
In some cases, it may be necessary to agree to disagree and move on to the next step in the sales process, if it becomes clear that the customer is not interested in pursuing the product or service being offered.
Ultimately, the key to overcoming objections is to remain calm, professional and focused on the customer's needs, and to use a combination of empathy, expertise and persuasion to address their concerns and help them make a decision.

Objection scenarios are rife with potential misunderstandings.
Average performers will launch into knee-jerk monologues addressing the wrong objection.

It runs down the clock against you.

Unpopular opinion: it is profoundly weird that the biggest names in applied behavioral science are academics who have never actually worked in a company leading applied behavioral science.

I am not sure I agree as I can list famous applied behavioural scientists leading industry teams (Rory Sutherland, David Halpern, Maya Shankar etc.). The many famous behavioural scientists I am familiar with have an array of academic, industry and government experience (equivalent to leading teams).
I agree that it may be difficult to build credibility in an applied setting though as often the projects have a commercial sensitivity about them and/or employees are restricted in what they can say publically (as it can impact the company's brand or even share price).
I have now (literally while writing this) developed an interesting hypothesis. I'd like to know if many famous behavioural scientists choose to work in academia (and work with industry) so that they have the freedom to communicate without restriction.

I can certainly list peers too, although when asked to name famous applied behavioral scientists in a recent MBA class at Columbia, most students named academics (Katy, Dan, etc.).

But I suspect you’re on to something about talking out loud. Academics have more time to write books, more freedom to do so, and greater rewards for doing so. They can often publish work (ditto for government folks) that industry folks can’t, although almost all of my employers have been exceedingly kind - my own lack of case study write ups is more about time and inclination than restriction (I’m also not explicitly rewarded for case studies in the same way as academics).

Not that I consider myself a “famous” behavioral economist, but yes, I truly enjoy academia because my research question and the answer doesn’t have to fit a “for profit” agenda or a company line. Also, I can go far deeper into a question than when I do consulting work because there is no deadline. The only deadline is the correct answer. There is no need for the result to be applicable right away. It’s also much more about developing a deeper and general understanding of behavior, rather than how behavior relates to one particular company and situation. 

As far as I know, Dan Ariely doesn’t do any active research anymore. He mostly does consulting and other company work. Many academics in behavioral science work closely with companies. Compared to their research output these engagements are just far less visible.

Christina Gravert Academia has a meaninfully different definition of what “right” means. In applied, right means “an ethical solution that changes behavior often enough at a cost/benefit ratio that is attractive to scale”. In academia, it is “p 0.05 and the ability to replicate”. So I think your last sentence is the right one - one exists to solve a problem, the other exists to further knowledge.

The post is about venerating knowledge generators as if they were behavior changers, when in fact they aren’t and use a different methodology and success criteria. No law against enjoying both. =]

Matt Wallaert I think the most curious thing is that those people that are perceived as “famous” by your MBA students etc, aren’t (usually) the best academics. At least not in behavioral economics. The famous ones are the science communicators, the ones on podcasts and who write popular science books. So these people get invited to speak because they make an effort to get invited and because they are skilled in communicating. So if practitioners want to get invited more, they might need to get out there more.

Matt Wallaert You should do that! I think it will be hard to evaluate who is actually great and not just famous ( in a company or in academia). Academia might be a bit easier with citations in respected journals. But how do you measure success in applying behavioral science in business?

I'm genuinely curious because I don't suspect any academic would consider themselves to be experts in how to get things done in organizations.

That's interesting; judging my DMs today, I don't think the applied side of the fence likely feels that way. 

But we could come up with some sort of behavioral test. How many panels, speaking opps, interviews, etc. have you personally turned down and sent to someone who has run behavioral science inside an organization, because you genuinely felt they were better equipped to answer those questions? Ditto for consulting opportunities?

For transparency, while I do send opps around to other practioners, I don't think I've ever sent such an opp to an academic (likely because I don't get invited to academic panels). I'd hope that I would have the courage to do that if the question itself was academic.

Matt Wallaert I guess it depends on whether it's a panel or consulting on the ""science"" or on using it in an organizational context [what some might call the science of using science] **text in brackets added later to clarify**. If the latter, then people like William R. Mailer Francesca Tamma Michael Hallsworth Nathalie Spencer Rory Sutherland Melanie Kim Piyush Tantia etc. are way better!

Also I wouldn't overgeneralize (as many of the commentators seem to) that academics have no practical experience. Those that consult for instance are perhaps advantaged in seeing different operating models and industries.

Finally fields like machine learning are similar, all the early big names were from academia. I think it's likely true for any new scientific discipline (unlike a mature HR that you cite as an example) but as the discipline matures, then we have enough HQPs outside academia.

All this to say, I think the situation is a bit more nuanced than ""academics vs practitioners"" and having scientists at the forefront of a science in its early applied years is not weird at all.

Dilip Soman You seem to be drawing a distinction I’m not sure I agree with. In the last paragraph, you seemed to suggest that only academics are scientists. And in the first, you drew a consulting distinction between “the science” and using the science.

To me, applied behavioral science is using science as a method for changing behavior. That means practitioners are scientists. Simply because their focus is on specific on a method for finding specific in-situ solutions rather than generalizable knowledge doesn’t make them any less scientists. 

You are absolutely right - there is a spectrum in how people spend their time and some people do both. I was shorthanding and it is a good clairification. Just as I would generally expect full-time academics to be better at generating knowledge, I would expect full-time practitioners to be better at running the behavioral science process in an organization.

You’re absolutely right about data science; it was originally lead by academics. But it didn’t stay that way. How are we pushing forward?

Matt Wallaert I'm using the stricter definition of science which is theory development and testing. The definition you used - I would call applied science or behavioral engineering.

How we move it forward is a great question. It's really by training and developing a quarter of highly qualified professionals. Programs like LSE's masters programs are key, But in my opinion it is equally important to embed these skills and knowledge sets in a traditional MBA and related program

Dilip Soman Certainly generalized theory is a specific use of the scientific method; I’m not sure I would call it stricter persay. But this whole post was about “applied behavioral science” (I swear I didn’t edit it) so now I’ve lost the thread - were you talking about academics being the better choice for generalizable theory the whole time? If so, I’m in violent agreement but don’t understand how it relates to consulting.

I think MBA programs are prime for this; the context of this comment was having just lectured at Columbia’s business school and having students name mostly academics when I asked them if they knew of any applied behavioral scientists. =]

Matt Wallaert Nah I was only referring to how we use the word ""science"" differently. It's the classic science vs engineering dichotomy (which might really be a spectrum). But this is all a distraction from the main point, you're right - I absolutely agree that this needs to be better embedded in the core management degree programs.

On terminology, in one of our partnership books we make the case for treating academic versus practitioner (where you work) and science versus engineering (what you do) orthogonally. Therefore one could be a practitioner and be engaged in science, likewise one could be in academia and be engaged in engineering.

Dilip Soman I don’t think it is quite classic engineering spectrum. If I’m building a bridge, I don’t generally run a pilot on the classic sense because gravity is a known. If I’m changing behavior, I can use prospect theory as a guide but there are a million reasons it might not work in that specific situation and thus have to use the scientific method, take it as theory, and test. The average applied BeSci is using the scientific method far more than the average mechanical, computer, or other engineer.

I do think we actually disagree, which shouldn’t be surprising given our different backgrounds. I also think that’s an OK thing; differing perspectives is a good thing for pushing a field forward.

Matt Wallaert Ah yes +1 to disagreement. I'll quickly add that in Behavioral Science in the Wild we do talk extensively about the lack of portability of results and it being a feature of beh science vs. other sciences (though as an engineer I can confirm that there's a LOT of testing in building machines and bridges, though ofc it's not an RCT). I don't think we as a field have good label for a behavioural engineer.

In any event, happy to agree to disagree on this one. It's just an issue of terminology, I think we agree on the key opinions.

Dilip Soman Do we? I think pretty big differences fall out of those terminology issues, so it is cascading disagreements. When academics start referring out more to the applied folks, I’ll believe it is just a terminology difference. =]

And yes, didn’t mean to overstate the degree to which mechanical engineers test, simply to make the point that on the sliding scale, they have to test less because more of their underlying forces are known.

Then we just need clearer terminology. I don't see any disagreements in opinions about what academic researchers do vs. practitioners driving practical problems in organizations do in terms of activity sets (esp. when it comes to defining ""success"" in respective careers). It's just that we disagree on what labels to give those activities. That's why I also like the decoupling of practitioner-academic (i.e., who you work for and what it means for career) vs, science-engineering (i.e., the kind of activity sets you engage in). The world happily assumes that they are perfectly correlated - they certainly are not.

On terminology going beyond science vs. engineering- in medicine there's a distinction between ""medical science"" (loosely, what academics do) and ""implementation science"" (how its used in patient care). Likewise, John List Nina Mažar (Mazar) and I would suggest that there is a distinction between ""science"" and the ""science of using science"" Maybe a high-council needs to take all these terms, and come up with some cleaner labels to describe different activity sets :-)

Dilip Soman So there is an area of disagreement: I believe they are correlated (maybe not perfectly but probably pretty high). People who do engineering all day, every day and their success depends on it are better at engineering and I can’t imagine an academic whose job success is predicated on their ability to be an engineer.

For non-correlation to occur, I feel like you'd have to argue reward criteria dont matter. As an example, I get paid on my ability to get people to actually do behavioral science in orgs, so I've become very good at that. And when project work comes my way (finding a specific intervention), I refer that out to ideas42, frog, and others because I am no longer the best person to solve it.

And maybe that’s what you’re saying. But then wouldn’t you agree that our current overrotation on people in the academic setting is odd?

Great question and discussion, and I am a little late in seeing it.

My quick take:

In general, practitioners who do BS in an organisation are often specialised and lack generalisable knowledge and expertise. How to do BS in one sector of IT is not the same as knowing what should be done elsewhere outside your industry. They also lack confidence that they have anything useful to share because they don't know what everyone else is doing.

Even if they know useful things, they aren't well incentivised or equipped to share that knowledge relative to just doing more work in their org etc.

In contrast, academics are rewarded for sharing high level knowledge about BS and can get a good overview about practice in many settings. This sets them up well to understand best practice and produce related content. These papers and interviews get picked up, and they build a following. Unfortunately, many academics aren't incentivised to really understand applied contexts, so they can easily miss some of the detail and get things wrong.

All of the above reminds me of the saying that those who know don't speak, and those who speak don't know! I am of course an exception ;)

I am not sure I agree as I can list famous applied behavioural scientists leading industry teams (Rory Sutherland, David Halpern, Maya Shankar etc.). The many famous behavioural scientists I am familiar with have an array of academic, industry and government experience (equivalent to leading teams).
I agree that it may be difficult to build credibility in an applied setting though as often the projects have a commercial sensitivity about them and/or employees are restricted in what they can say publically (as it can impact the company's brand or even share price).
I have now (literally while writing this) developed an interesting hypothesis. I'd like to know if many famous behavioural scientists choose to work in academia (and work with industry) so that they have the freedom to communicate without restriction.

I can certainly list peers too, although when asked to name famous applied behavioral scientists in a recent MBA class at Columbia, most students named academics (Katy, Dan, etc.).

But I suspect you’re on to something about talking out loud. Academics have more time to write books, more freedom to do so, and greater rewards for doing so. They can often publish work (ditto for government folks) that industry folks can’t, although almost all of my employers have been exceedingly kind - my own lack of case study write ups is more about time and inclination than restriction (I’m also not explicitly rewarded for case studies in the same way as academics).

Not that I consider myself a “famous” behavioral economist, but yes, I truly enjoy academia because my research question and the answer doesn’t have to fit a “for profit” agenda or a company line. Also, I can go far deeper into a question than when I do consulting work because there is no deadline. The only deadline is the correct answer. There is no need for the result to be applicable right away. It’s also much more about developing a deeper and general understanding of behavior, rather than how behavior relates to one particular company and situation. 

As far as I know, Dan Ariely doesn’t do any active research anymore. He mostly does consulting and other company work. Many academics in behavioral science work closely with companies. Compared to their research output these engagements are just far less visible.

Christina Gravert Academia has a meaninfully different definition of what “right” means. In applied, right means “an ethical solution that changes behavior often enough at a cost/benefit ratio that is attractive to scale”. In academia, it is “p 0.05 and the ability to replicate”. So I think your last sentence is the right one - one exists to solve a problem, the other exists to further knowledge.

The post is about venerating knowledge generators as if they were behavior changers, when in fact they aren’t and use a different methodology and success criteria. No law against enjoying both. =]

Matt Wallaert I think the most curious thing is that those people that are perceived as “famous” by your MBA students etc, aren’t (usually) the best academics. At least not in behavioral economics. The famous ones are the science communicators, the ones on podcasts and who write popular science books. So these people get invited to speak because they make an effort to get invited and because they are skilled in communicating. So if practitioners want to get invited more, they might need to get out there more.

That's interesting; judging my DMs today, I don't think the applied side of the fence likely feels that way. 

But we could come up with some sort of behavioral test. How many panels, speaking opps, interviews, etc. have you personally turned down and sent to someone who has run behavioral science inside an organization, because you genuinely felt they were better equipped to answer those questions? Ditto for consulting opportunities?

For transparency, while I do send opps around to other practioners, I don't think I've ever sent such an opp to an academic (likely because I don't get invited to academic panels). I'd hope that I would have the courage to do that if the question itself was academic.

Matt Wallaert I guess it depends on whether it's a panel or consulting on the ""science"" or on using it in an organizational context [what some might call the science of using science] **text in brackets added later to clarify**. If the latter, then people like William R. Mailer Francesca Tamma Michael Hallsworth Nathalie Spencer Rory Sutherland Melanie Kim Piyush Tantia etc. are way better!

Also I wouldn't overgeneralize (as many of the commentators seem to) that academics have no practical experience. Those that consult for instance are perhaps advantaged in seeing different operating models and industries.

Finally fields like machine learning are similar, all the early big names were from academia. I think it's likely true for any new scientific discipline (unlike a mature HR that you cite as an example) but as the discipline matures, then we have enough HQPs outside academia.

I can certainly list peers too, although when asked to name famous applied behavioral scientists in a recent MBA class at Columbia, most students named academics (Katy, Dan, etc.).

But I suspect you’re on to something about talking out loud. Academics have more time to write books, more freedom to do so, and greater rewards for doing so. They can often publish work (ditto for government folks) that industry folks can’t, although almost all of my employers have been exceedingly kind - my own lack of case study write ups is more about time and inclination than restriction (I’m also not explicitly rewarded for case studies in the same way as academics).

Not that I consider myself a “famous” behavioral economist, but yes, I truly enjoy academia because my research question and the answer doesn’t have to fit a “for profit” agenda or a company line. Also, I can go far deeper into a question than when I do consulting work because there is no deadline. The only deadline is the correct answer. There is no need for the result to be applicable right away. It’s also much more about developing a deeper and general understanding of behavior, rather than how behavior relates to one particular company and situation. 

As far as I know, Dan Ariely doesn’t do any active research anymore. He mostly does consulting and other company work. Many academics in behavioral science work closely with companies. Compared to their research output these engagements are just far less visible.

Christina Gravert Academia has a meaninfully different definition of what “right” means. In applied, right means “an ethical solution that changes behavior often enough at a cost/benefit ratio that is attractive to scale”. In academia, it is “p 0.05 and the ability to replicate”. So I think your last sentence is the right one - one exists to solve a problem, the other exists to further knowledge.

The post is about venerating knowledge generators as if they were behavior changers, when in fact they aren’t and use a different methodology and success criteria. No law against enjoying both. =]

Matt Wallaert I think the most curious thing is that those people that are perceived as “famous” by your MBA students etc, aren’t (usually) the best academics. At least not in behavioral economics. The famous ones are the science communicators, the ones on podcasts and who write popular science books. So these people get invited to speak because they make an effort to get invited and because they are skilled in communicating. So if practitioners want to get invited more, they might need to get out there more.

Matt Wallaert You should do that! I think it will be hard to evaluate who is actually great and not just famous ( in a company or in academia). Academia might be a bit easier with citations in respected journals. But how do you measure success in applying behavioral science in business?

That's interesting; judging my DMs today, I don't think the applied side of the fence likely feels that way. 

But we could come up with some sort of behavioral test. How many panels, speaking opps, interviews, etc. have you personally turned down and sent to someone who has run behavioral science inside an organization, because you genuinely felt they were better equipped to answer those questions? Ditto for consulting opportunities?

For transparency, while I do send opps around to other practioners, I don't think I've ever sent such an opp to an academic (likely because I don't get invited to academic panels). I'd hope that I would have the courage to do that if the question itself was academic.

Matt Wallaert I guess it depends on whether it's a panel or consulting on the ""science"" or on using it in an organizational context [what some might call the science of using science] **text in brackets added later to clarify**. If the latter, then people like William R. Mailer Francesca Tamma Michael Hallsworth Nathalie Spencer Rory Sutherland Melanie Kim Piyush Tantia etc. are way better!

Also I wouldn't overgeneralize (as many of the commentators seem to) that academics have no practical experience. Those that consult for instance are perhaps advantaged in seeing different operating models and industries.

Finally fields like machine learning are similar, all the early big names were from academia. I think it's likely true for any new scientific discipline (unlike a mature HR that you cite as an example) but as the discipline matures, then we have enough HQPs outside academia.

All this to say, I think the situation is a bit more nuanced than ""academics vs practitioners"" and having scientists at the forefront of a science in its early applied years is not weird at all.

Dilip Soman You seem to be drawing a distinction I’m not sure I agree with. In the last paragraph, you seemed to suggest that only academics are scientists. And in the first, you drew a consulting distinction between “the science” and using the science.

To me, applied behavioral science is using science as a method for changing behavior. That means practitioners are scientists. Simply because their focus is on specific on a method for finding specific in-situ solutions rather than generalizable knowledge doesn’t make them any less scientists. 

You are absolutely right - there is a spectrum in how people spend their time and some people do both. I was shorthanding and it is a good clairification. Just as I would generally expect full-time academics to be better at generating knowledge, I would expect full-time practitioners to be better at running the behavioral science process in an organization.

You’re absolutely right about data science; it was originally lead by academics. But it didn’t stay that way. How are we pushing forward?

Matt Wallaert I'm using the stricter definition of science which is theory development and testing. The definition you used - I would call applied science or behavioral engineering.

How we move it forward is a great question. It's really by training and developing a quarter of highly qualified professionals. Programs like LSE's masters programs are key, But in my opinion it is equally important to embed these skills and knowledge sets in a traditional MBA and related program

Dilip Soman Certainly generalized theory is a specific use of the scientific method; I’m not sure I would call it stricter persay. But this whole post was about “applied behavioral science” (I swear I didn’t edit it) so now I’ve lost the thread - were you talking about academics being the better choice for generalizable theory the whole time? If so, I’m in violent agreement but don’t understand how it relates to consulting.

I think MBA programs are prime for this; the context of this comment was having just lectured at Columbia’s business school and having students name mostly academics when I asked them if they knew of any applied behavioral scientists. =]

Matt Wallaert Nah I was only referring to how we use the word ""science"" differently. It's the classic science vs engineering dichotomy (which might really be a spectrum). But this is all a distraction from the main point, you're right - I absolutely agree that this needs to be better embedded in the core management degree programs.

On terminology, in one of our partnership books we make the case for treating academic versus practitioner (where you work) and science versus engineering (what you do) orthogonally. Therefore one could be a practitioner and be engaged in science, likewise one could be in academia and be engaged in engineering.

Dilip Soman I don’t think it is quite classic engineering spectrum. If I’m building a bridge, I don’t generally run a pilot on the classic sense because gravity is a known. If I’m changing behavior, I can use prospect theory as a guide but there are a million reasons it might not work in that specific situation and thus have to use the scientific method, take it as theory, and test. The average applied BeSci is using the scientific method far more than the average mechanical, computer, or other engineer.

I do think we actually disagree, which shouldn’t be surprising given our different backgrounds. I also think that’s an OK thing; differing perspectives is a good thing for pushing a field forward.

Matt Wallaert Ah yes +1 to disagreement. I'll quickly add that in Behavioral Science in the Wild we do talk extensively about the lack of portability of results and it being a feature of beh science vs. other sciences (though as an engineer I can confirm that there's a LOT of testing in building machines and bridges, though ofc it's not an RCT). I don't think we as a field have good label for a behavioural engineer.

In any event, happy to agree to disagree on this one. It's just an issue of terminology, I think we agree on the key opinions.

Dilip Soman Do we? I think pretty big differences fall out of those terminology issues, so it is cascading disagreements. When academics start referring out more to the applied folks, I’ll believe it is just a terminology difference. =]

And yes, didn’t mean to overstate the degree to which mechanical engineers test, simply to make the point that on the sliding scale, they have to test less because more of their underlying forces are known.

Then we just need clearer terminology. I don't see any disagreements in opinions about what academic researchers do vs. practitioners driving practical problems in organizations do in terms of activity sets (esp. when it comes to defining ""success"" in respective careers). It's just that we disagree on what labels to give those activities. That's why I also like the decoupling of practitioner-academic (i.e., who you work for and what it means for career) vs, science-engineering (i.e., the kind of activity sets you engage in). The world happily assumes that they are perfectly correlated - they certainly are not.

On terminology going beyond science vs. engineering- in medicine there's a distinction between ""medical science"" (loosely, what academics do) and ""implementation science"" (how its used in patient care). Likewise, John List Nina Mažar (Mazar) and I would suggest that there is a distinction between ""science"" and the ""science of using science"" Maybe a high-council needs to take all these terms, and come up with some cleaner labels to describe different activity sets :-)

Dilip Soman So there is an area of disagreement: I believe they are correlated (maybe not perfectly but probably pretty high). People who do engineering all day, every day and their success depends on it are better at engineering and I can’t imagine an academic whose job success is predicated on their ability to be an engineer.

For non-correlation to occur, I feel like you'd have to argue reward criteria dont matter. As an example, I get paid on my ability to get people to actually do behavioral science in orgs, so I've become very good at that. And when project work comes my way (finding a specific intervention), I refer that out to ideas42, frog, and others because I am no longer the best person to solve it.

And maybe that’s what you’re saying. But then wouldn’t you agree that our current overrotation on people in the academic setting is odd?

Matt Wallaert Actually I agree that they are probably correlated, but conceptually they needn't be. I guess I know enough people that are on the ""off diagonals"" and perhaps these are the people who should be driving change.

Great question and discussion, and I am a little late in seeing it.

My quick take:

In general, practitioners who do BS in an organisation are often specialised and lack generalisable knowledge and expertise. How to do BS in one sector of IT is not the same as knowing what should be done elsewhere outside your industry. They also lack confidence that they have anything useful to share because they don't know what everyone else is doing.

Even if they know useful things, they aren't well incentivised or equipped to share that knowledge relative to just doing more work in their org etc.

In contrast, academics are rewarded for sharing high level knowledge about BS and can get a good overview about practice in many settings. This sets them up well to understand best practice and produce related content. These papers and interviews get picked up, and they build a following. Unfortunately, many academics aren't incentivised to really understand applied contexts, so they can easily miss some of the detail and get things wrong.

All of the above reminds me of the saying that those who know don't speak, and those who speak don't know! I am of course an exception ;)

I am not sure I agree as I can list famous applied behavioural scientists leading industry teams (Rory Sutherland, David Halpern, Maya Shankar etc.). The many famous behavioural scientists I am familiar with have an array of academic, industry and government experience (equivalent to leading teams).
I agree that it may be difficult to build credibility in an applied setting though as often the projects have a commercial sensitivity about them and/or employees are restricted in what they can say publically (as it can impact the company's brand or even share price).
I have now (literally while writing this) developed an interesting hypothesis. I'd like to know if many famous behavioural scientists choose to work in academia (and work with industry) so that they have the freedom to communicate without restriction.

I don't see any disagreements in opinions about what academic researchers do vs. practitioners driving practical problems in organizations do in terms of activity sets (esp. when it comes to defining ""success"" in respective careers). It's just that we disagree on what labels to give those activities. That's why I also like the decoupling of practitioner-academic (i.e., who you work for and what it means for career) vs, science-engineering (i.e., the kind of activity sets you engage in). The world happily assumes that they are perfectly correlated - they certainly are not.

On terminology going beyond science vs. engineering- in medicine there's a distinction between ""medical science"" (loosely, what academics do) and ""implementation science"" (how its used in patient care). Likewise, John List Nina Mažar (Mazar) and I would suggest that there is a distinction between ""science"" and the ""science of using science"" Maybe a high-council needs to take all these terms, and come up with some cleaner labels to describe different activity sets :-)

Dilip Soman So there is an area of disagreement: I believe they are correlated (maybe not perfectly but probably pretty high). People who do engineering all day, every day and their success depends on it are better at engineering and I can’t imagine an academic whose job success is predicated on their ability to be an engineer.

For non-correlation to occur, I feel like you'd have to argue reward criteria dont matter. As an example, I get paid on my ability to get people to actually do behavioral science in orgs, so I've become very good at that. And when project work comes my way (finding a specific intervention), I refer that out to ideas42, frog, and others because I am no longer the best person to solve it.

And maybe that’s what you’re saying. But then wouldn’t you agree that our current overrotation on people in the academic setting is odd?

Matt Wallaert Actually I agree that they are probably correlated, but conceptually they needn't be. I guess I know enough people that are on the ""off diagonals"" and perhaps these are the people who should be driving change.

Great question and discussion, and I am a little late in seeing it.

My quick take:

In general, practitioners who do BS in an organisation are often specialised and lack generalisable knowledge and expertise. How to do BS in one sector of IT is not the same as knowing what should be done elsewhere outside your industry. They also lack confidence that they have anything useful to share because they don't know what everyone else is doing.

Even if they know useful things, they aren't well incentivised or equipped to share that knowledge relative to just doing more work in their org etc.

In contrast, academics are rewarded for sharing high level knowledge about BS and can get a good overview about practice in many settings. This sets them up well to understand best practice and produce related content. These papers and interviews get picked up, and they build a following. Unfortunately, many academics aren't incentivised to really understand applied contexts, so they can easily miss some of the detail and get things wrong.

All of the above reminds me of the saying that those who know don't speak, and those who speak don't know! I am of course an exception ;)

"2 / 2The Elves begin to set up camp on the beach. To decide whose tent gets to be closest to the snack storage, a giant Rock Paper Scissors tournament is already in progress.

Rock Paper Scissors is a game between two players. Each game contains many rounds; in each round, the players each simultaneously choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors using a hand shape. Then, a winner for that round is selected: Rock defeats Scissors, Scissors defeats Paper, and Paper defeats Rock. If both players choose the same shape, the round instead ends in a draw.

Appreciative of your help yesterday, one Elf gives you an encrypted strategy guide (your puzzle input) that they say will be sure to help you win. ""The first column is what your opponent is going to play: A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors. The second column--"" Suddenly, the Elf is called away to help with someone's tent.

The second column, you reason, must be what you should play in response: X for Rock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors. Winning every time would be suspicious, so the responses must have been carefully chosen.

The winner of the whole tournament is the player with the highest score. Your total score is the sum of your scores for each round. The score for a single round is the score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).

Since you can't be sure if the Elf is trying to help you or trick you, you should calculate the score you would get if you were to follow the strategy guide.

For example, suppose you were given the following strategy guide:

A Y
B X
C Z
This strategy guide predicts and recommends the following:

In the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you should choose Paper (Y). This ends in a win for you with a score of 8 (2 because you chose Paper + 6 because you won).
In the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you should choose Rock (X). This ends in a loss for you with a score of 1 (1 + 0).
The third round is a draw with both players choosing Scissors, giving you a score of 3 + 3 = 6.
In this example, if you were to follow the strategy guide, you would get a total score of 15 (8 + 1 + 6).

"2 / 2We have an assignment in which we are doing exploratory data analysis. I need your help during the process. Here's the assignment and code I have so far:

######### Assignment ########
## Task
We will be focusing on the yelp business dataset to do an exploratory analysis. This dataset provides information about businesses, user reviews, and more from Yelp's database. The data is split into separate files (business, checkin, photos, review, tip, and user), and is available in either JSON or SQL format. You might use this to investigate the distributions of scores on yelp, look at how many reviews users typically leave or look for regional trends about restaurants. Note that this is a large, structured dataset and you don't need to look at all of the data to answer interesting questions.

Prior to analysis – you should write down an initial set of at least three questions you'd like to investigate.

Next, you will perform an exploratory analysis of your dataset using a visualization tool such as Vega-Lite/Altair or Tableau. You should consider two different phases of exploration.

In the first phase, you should seek to gain an overview of the shape & structure of your dataset. What variables does the dataset contain? How are they distributed? Are there any notable data quality issues? Are there any surprising relationships among the variables? Be sure to perform ""sanity checks"" for any patterns you expect the data to contain.

In the second phase, you should investigate your initial questions, as well as any new questions that arise during your exploration. For each question, start by creating a visualization that might provide a useful answer. Then refine the visualization (by adding additional variables, changing sorting or axis scales, filtering or subsetting data, etc.) to develop better perspectives, explore unexpected observations, or sanity check your assumptions. You should repeat this process for each of your questions, but feel free to revise your questions or branch off to explore new questions if the data warrants.

## Final Deliverable
Your final submission should take the form of a sequence of images – similar to a comic book – that consists of 8 or more visualizations detailing your most important observations.
Your observations can include important surprises or issues (such as data quality problems affecting your analysis) as well as responses to your analysis questions. Where appropriate, we encourage you to include annotated visualizations to guide viewers' attention and provide interpretive context. (If you aren't sure what we mean by ""annotated visualization,"" see this page for some examples.)
Provide sufficient detail such that anyone can read your report and understand what you've learned without already being familiar with the dataset. To help gauge the scope of this assignment, see this example report analyzing motion picture data.

"2 / 2We have an assignment in which we are doing exploratory data analysis. I need your help during the process. Here's the assignment and code I have so far:

######### Assignment ########
## Task
We will be focusing on the yelp business dataset to do an exploratory analysis. This dataset provides information about businesses, user reviews, and more from Yelp's database. The data is split into separate files (business, checkin, photos, review, tip, and user), and is available in either JSON or SQL format. You might use this to investigate the distributions of scores on yelp, look at how many reviews users typically leave or look for regional trends about restaurants. Note that this is a large, structured dataset and you don't need to look at all of the data to answer interesting questions.

Prior to analysis – you should write down an initial set of at least three questions you'd like to investigate.

Next, you will perform an exploratory analysis of your dataset using a visualization tool such as Vega-Lite/Altair or Tableau. You should consider two different phases of exploration.

In the first phase, you should seek to gain an overview of the shape & structure of your dataset. What variables does the dataset contain? How are they distributed? Are there any notable data quality issues? Are there any surprising relationships among the variables? Be sure to perform ""sanity checks"" for any patterns you expect the data to contain.

In the second phase, you should investigate your initial questions, as well as any new questions that arise during your exploration. For each question, start by creating a visualization that might provide a useful answer. Then refine the visualization (by adding additional variables, changing sorting or axis scales, filtering or subsetting data, etc.) to develop better perspectives, explore unexpected observations, or sanity check your assumptions. You should repeat this process for each of your questions, but feel free to revise your questions or branch off to explore new questions if the data warrants.

## Final Deliverable
Your final submission should take the form of a sequence of images – similar to a comic book – that consists of 8 or more visualizations detailing your most important observations.
Your observations can include important surprises or issues (such as data quality problems affecting your analysis) as well as responses to your analysis questions. Where appropriate, we encourage you to include annotated visualizations to guide viewers' attention and provide interpretive context. (If you aren't sure what we mean by ""annotated visualization,"" see this page for some examples.)
Provide sufficient detail such that anyone can read your report and understand what you've learned without already being familiar with the dataset. To help gauge the scope of this assignment, see this example report analyzing motion picture data.

"2 / 2We have an assignment in which we are doing exploratory data analysis. I need your help during the process. Here's the assignment and code I have so far:

######### Assignment ########
## Task
We will be focusing on the yelp business dataset to do an exploratory analysis. This dataset provides information about businesses, user reviews, and more from Yelp's database. The data is split into separate files (business, checkin, photos, review, tip, and user), and is available in either JSON or SQL format. You might use this to investigate the distributions of scores on yelp, look at how many reviews users typically leave or look for regional trends about restaurants. Note that this is a large, structured dataset and you don't need to look at all of the data to answer interesting questions.

Prior to analysis – you should write down an initial set of at least three questions you'd like to investigate.

Next, you will perform an exploratory analysis of your dataset using a visualization tool such as Vega-Lite/Altair or Tableau. You should consider two different phases of exploration.

In the first phase, you should seek to gain an overview of the shape & structure of your dataset. What variables does the dataset contain? How are they distributed? Are there any notable data quality issues? Are there any surprising relationships among the variables? Be sure to perform ""sanity checks"" for any patterns you expect the data to contain.

In the second phase, you should investigate your initial questions, as well as any new questions that arise during your exploration. For each question, start by creating a visualization that might provide a useful answer. Then refine the visualization (by adding additional variables, changing sorting or axis scales, filtering or subsetting data, etc.) to develop better perspectives, explore unexpected observations, or sanity check your assumptions. You should repeat this process for each of your questions, but feel free to revise your questions or branch off to explore new questions if the data warrants.

## Final Deliverable
Your final submission should take the form of a sequence of images – similar to a comic book – that consists of 8 or more visualizations detailing your most important observations.
Your observations can include important surprises or issues (such as data quality problems affecting your analysis) as well as responses to your analysis questions. Where appropriate, we encourage you to include annotated visualizations to guide viewers' attention and provide interpretive context. (If you aren't sure what we mean by ""annotated visualization,"" see this page for some examples.)
Provide sufficient detail such that anyone can read your report and understand what you've learned without already being familiar with the dataset. To help gauge the scope of this assignment, see this example report analyzing motion picture data.

## Initial Questions

1. How are rating stars distributed in Nashville?
2. How do rating stars correlate with different attributes of food businesses in Nashville?
3. How do combinations of different attributes impact rating stars of food businesses in Nashville?

What are the biggest challenges you face in your daily work as a Talent Acquisition professional?
7 responses
when skills on resume doesn't match when we talk to candidate
Blocked by lack of response / follow through from other BUs which in turns delays deliverables and can negatively affect the candidates experience
1. Multiple use of Spreadsheet
2. Limited access to platform while hiring for specific geography for example scouring for FE Engineers in a city where we have not hired earlier; right now its job portal but limited talent pool and lower response rate results in higher outreach to lower conversion
3.Multiple meetings
Time Management
I don't have any big challenges that I can't handle as a TA professional.
Accurate comp bands, correct radford codes and consistent global hiring process.
When things are busy and begin to hectic, it can be difficult to prioritize each req/task. This is typically resolved through strong communication between all members of the TA team and hiring managers - something we do a very good job with at Thoughtspot!
What tasks or processes do you find to be the most time-consuming or tedious?

Overall, I'd say passively sourcing for specific/quality profiles takes the most time. This consists of thoroughly viewing each individual candidates specific profile/resume/etc.

A few months ago I'd say being able to automate my outreach process, especially the initial outreach, would be extremely beneficial, but this is something I'm currently setting up in Gem! It's a much more time efficient process.

7 responses
sharing details and making sure candidate is clear about the organisation and about the role
Time to fill for all positions across the board (shortening the interview process) seeing an increase in applicants not moving forward as we've taken too long to get back to them
Overall Candidate Experience
Sharing relevant, detailed and specific JD
TAC Call to candidate to check on candidate availability, Quicker closures on candidate interviews
Better candidate Interview template
Following up with candidates and keeping them warm
candidate experience
Consistent global approach to opening reqs, accurate comp bands and scorecards being completed.
From my perspective, people will always be the top priority and ThoughtSpot has hired some fantastic team members in the last year! With so many moving pieces/teams/etc I'd say communication and transparency are also top priorities. Again, these are all things I think we do fantastic, but also believe these are areas that can always be improved.

Time Management
I don't have any big challenges that I can't handle as a TA professional.
Accurate comp bands, correct radford codes and consistent global hiring process.
When things are busy and begin to hectic, it can be difficult to prioritize each req/task. This is typically resolved through strong communication between all members of the TA team and hiring managers - something we do a very good job with at Thoughtspot!
What tasks or processes do you find to be the most time-consuming or tedious?
7 responses
Accepting inmails on linkedin
Copying data between systems, replying to FAQs (this should change in the near future with the candidate FAQ website buildout), scheduling interviews, UK background checks
Updating spreadsheet
Rescheduling and getting slot from Panel
none in my role
Souring
Overall, I'd say passively sourcing for specific/quality profiles takes the most time. This consists of thoroughly viewing each individual candidates specific profile/resume/etc.
Are there any specific tools or platforms that you currently use to support your work, and if so, how effective are they in helping you achieve your goals?
7 responses
open ai
Fellow (very effective) Asana (effective) self reminders (effective)
LinkedIn - outreach, creating projects, to understand overall outreach effort
RecruitIn.Net - X-ray search
Naukri.com - Job Portal to tap active candidates , access to their resumes, phone number and email id.
Yeah GH it is very much helpful in tracking candidates status
My tools and platforms that I can't do without are Greenhouse, GEM, LinkedIn recruiter, and Calendly.
None outside of what we already already use.
Our stack includes Gem, Linkedin Recruiter, Mogul and GreenHouse. All of these tools are very helpful in my day to day tasks. Gem is certainly the most intuitive and efficient platform I currently use.
Are there any features or capabilities that you feel are missing from your current tools that would make your work easier or more efficient?
7 responses
getting the work done easily
Collaboration + visibility into other colleagues day to day / project work
LinkedIN Talent Insights
Not as of now
no
None outside of what we already use.
A few months ago I'd say being able to automate my outreach process, especially the initial outreach, would be extremely beneficial, but this is something I'm currently setting up in Gem! It's a much more time efficient process.
Are there any automation workflows, apps, or tools that you have heard of or used in the past that you think could be useful for your team?
7 responses
yes
Nothing comes to mind, I feel like we are a step ahead when it comes to tools and apps --very much excited about the future use of AI, that'll be a huge help!
ATS - Taleo, Icims were useful for reporting and for full cycle recruting.
If Panel availability and their bandwidth is captured it would be great
We are already using the ones that are useful for the team.
None outside of what we already use.
The only one I can think of is SeekOut in terms of getting potential contact information, but I feel like Gem does that well and has far more capabilities.
What would be your top priority when it comes to improving the recruiting process?
7 responses
sharing details and making sure candidate is clear about the organisation and about the role
Time to fill for all positions across the board (shortening the interview process) seeing an increase in applicants not moving forward as we've taken too long to get back to them
Overall Candidate Experience
Sharing relevant, detailed and specific JD
TAC Call to candidate to check on candidate availability, Quicker closures on candidate interviews
Better candidate Interview template
Following up with candidates and keeping them warm
candidate experience
Consistent global approach to opening reqs, accurate comp bands and scorecards being completed.
From my perspective, people will always be the top priority and ThoughtSpot has hired some fantastic team members in the last year! With so many moving pieces/teams/etc I'd say communication and transparency are also top priorities. Again, these are all things I think we do fantastic, but also believe these are areas that can always be improved.

Sourcing
It's going to sound much easier said than done, but it would be automation. Being able to automate a manual process that we continuously/often do would give back a ton of time. For example, a generic initial reach out messaging sequence. ",base,0.45468106187760865

Incoming call, alarm clock etc. trashes voice message recording #3002 Description:
I'm getting many complaints regarding a reproducible issue when voice messages are being recorded.

When someone is recording a voice message, did already 10 minutes, and i.e. some of these things are happening:

Incoming call
Alarm clock of the smart phone fires
A timer runs off
iPhone popup asks for network provider updates
...
The voice message is fully trashed into nowhere. Users are losing the complete message at this time.

In case of an incoming call the app should save the message at this point and give the option to at least send the message up to this point after returning to the app when the disturbing event is over (like in WhatsApp) or don't bother about the incoming call and just continue to record (like in Signal).

Environment Information:
Rocket.Chat Server Version: 3.12.1
Rocket.Chat App Version: 4.15.0
Device Name: iPhone, iPad
OS Version: IOS 14.4.1
Steps to reproduce:
Record a voice message
Make a phone call to the device which is recording
The voice message recording stops and all recording which was done is gone
Expected behavior:
Either the recording should continue (and the user can decide to send it in case he wants to pick up the call) or the recording is temporary saved and can be sent after the disturbing event like WhatsApp does. However, it should never be just trashed.

Actual behavior:
All recorded content is immediately stopped, trashed and will be lost.

Additional context:
After a recording is lost due to this, in addition the recording function is not working after that anymore. The user must force-quit the complete app and restart it to restore voice recording functionality.",none,0.6795467660250242

Eng. D. Zaglia	Off Highway	Arco, Italy	June 7th, 2021


Requestor name:	Service Request ID:	Location:	Business Unit:
Mr. L. Fornoli	n.a.	Arco, Italy	Off Highway


Test Materials
Part Name:	Part Number:	Revision Level:	Model Series:	Samples N°:
755 Front Agri Axle	10145957	Proto 0	M2 21V CVT	1


Test Scope
According to the DVP&amp;R of the M2 21V CVT project, It was requested a reduction of the power loss of the previous test 96_20 (std oil level) a new test was required for 755/10145957 MF Front Agri axle w/ reduced oil level (-0.5 lt.), Oil ELF SF3:
Power Loss vs. rpm up to 3234 rpm (53 kph) in @ 90, 60 °C, T amb. 25°C – FWD and REV (test diagrams file);
P&amp;T: Power Loss &amp; Temperature Raise @ 53 kph FWD;
Lube: different combinations of speed, direction, temperatures, 0°, monitoring oil levels in critical areas.
Ref. tests: 02_17 (755/611 M2), 05_17 (740/623 M2-19); 96_20 (755 M2-21 std oil level).

Summary of Results
Test completed w/o any issue, in particular no lubrication issues and no oil leak. Main results (96_20):
Power Loss vs. rpm @ 90°C 3.60 (4.55) kW, 60 °C 4.2 (5.7) kW, T amb. 8.1 (10.3) kW, after run-in; for other cond., see foll. Tab); In REV, Power Loss less than FWD.
P&amp;T: @ 1 hr 6’ 85°C, 2.8 kW, then changing w/ Power Loss step and no stabilization, (ref. to 20°C amb.).; @ 2 hrs, about 110°C, 5.3 kW;
Lube: @ horizontal not any sign of lubrication problems (all P and T curves w/ normal behavior) oil levels in inclined not performed due to not suitable bench availability.
Final tear down: done after the following Hi-speed test  97_20.

	Test Result
	Partially PASSED: Improved but same Power Loss step


Conclusions 
The 755/10145957 “M2 21V CVT” axle did Partially passed the P&amp;T + Lube test due to:
P&amp;T test: Temperature in central remained below 120°C (max. allowable) within target 2 hrs, but curves become not regular behavior (P. Loss step up) after 1hr:6’ w/ no stabilization;
Power Loss values significantly lower than reference test w/ M2 axle and also of 740 axle (ref. 05_17);
Lubrication: oil level always above min. oil level in all compartments.
Advised to not reduce further oil level unless the Power Loss step-up is solved.
Others: no oil leak and not any lubrication problem.

Test start: April 7th, 2021; April 8th, 2021.

Lube: @ horizontal not any sign of lubrication problems (all P and T curves w/ normal behavior) oil levels in inclined not performed due to not suitable bench availability.
Final tear down: done after the following Hi-speed test  97_20.

	Test Result
	Partially PASSED: Improved but same Power Loss step


Conclusions 
The 755/10145957 “M2 21V CVT” axle did Partially passed the P&amp;T + Lube test due to:
P&amp;T test: Temperature in central remained below 120°C (max. allowable) within target 2 hrs, but curves become not regular behavior (P. Loss step up) after 1hr:6’ w/ no stabilization;
Power Loss values significantly lower than reference test w/ M2 axle and also of 740 axle (ref. 05_17);
Lubrication: oil level always above min. oil level in all compartments.

P&amp;T: Power Loss &amp; Temperature Raise @ 53 kph FWD;
Lube: different combinations of speed, direction, temperatures, 0°, monitoring oil levels in critical areas.
Ref. tests: 02_17 (755/611 M2), 05_17 (740/623 M2-19); 96_20 (755 M2-21 std oil level).

Summary of Results
Test completed w/o any issue, in particular no lubrication issues and no oil leak. Main results (96_20):
Power Loss vs. rpm @ 90°C 3.60 (4.55) kW, 60 °C 4.2 (5.7) kW, T amb. 8.1 (10.3) kW, after run-in; for other cond., see foll. Tab); In REV, Power Loss less than FWD.
P&amp;T: @ 1 hr 6’ 85°C, 2.8 kW, then changing w/ Power Loss step and no stabilization, (ref. to 20°C amb.).; @ 2 hrs, about 110°C, 5.3 kW;
Lube: @ horizontal not any sign of lubrication problems (all P and T curves w/ normal behavior) oil levels in inclined not performed due to not suitable bench availability.
Final tear down: done after the following Hi-speed test  97_20.

	Test Result
	Partially PASSED: Improved but same Power Loss step


Conclusions 
The 755/10145957 “M2 21V CVT” axle did Partially passed the P&amp;T + Lube test due to:
P&amp;T test: Temperature in central remained below 120°C (max. allowable) within target 2 hrs, but curves become not regular behavior (P. Loss step up) after 1hr:6’ w/ no stabilization;
Power Loss values significantly lower than reference test w/ M2 axle and also of 740 axle (ref. 05_17);

Article: ""What China can still do to avoid an enormous covid death toll It must treat hospitals as a precious resource and start stockpiling drugs People wearing face masks walk in a subway station, as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks continue in Shanghai, China, December 8, 2022. Testing stations are being removed from city streets. The enforcers of “zero-covid” are nowhere to be found. In China’s battle against covid-19, the state has disappeared from the front lines. For nearly three years President Xi Jinping tried to contain the virus, calling his efforts a “people’s war”. Now he has surrendered and the people must live with the enemy. Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android. Mr Xi is not the first leader to conclude that such a fight was unwinnable. But before ditching their zero-covid policies, other countries first took pains to administer vaccines, stockpile antiviral drugs and draw up treatment guidelines. China had ample time to do all of that. Yet more than two years after the first vaccine proved effective, the country remains ill-prepared. That has made opening up much more dangerous than it ought to be. How dangerous? In this week’s China section we publish our model of how the epidemic might play out. It comes with essential caveats. Modelling an epidemic is difficult. Modelling one in China, where the data are often unreliable, is even harder. We take into account variables such as vaccination rates, the effectiveness of Chinese jabs, the lethality of covid for different age groups and the number of intensive-care beds. In a worst case, if covid spreads freely and many people cannot get care, we estimate that in the coming months 1.5m Chinese people will die from the virus. Although that is a lower share of the population than in many rich countries, it is still a criticism of the government’s poor preparations. It is also a call to action. A vaccination drive will take months. The government has waited too long to build and staff new icus. But even if the state will not impose lockdowns while it prepares, it can mitigate the number of deaths. It should start by protecting the health system. A wave of covid is breaking over China. Our model sees this peaking in January. By that time hospitals risk being overwhelmed. Beds and staff are a precious resource to be husbanded. That means keeping people who are not seriously ill away from hospitals. To that end, the state could help drug companies restock pharmacies that run out of such things as lateral-flow tests and paracetamol. Medical staff should be vaccinated first and they must be given the proper gear to minimise the risk of infection. A second step is to ensure cheap and plentiful supplies of covid drugs. Dexamethasone, a low-priced steroid, has been shown to reduce deaths among the most severely ill patients. Antivirals, such as Paxlovid, help keep those most at risk out of hospital. These drugs have become part of the toolkit doctors around the world are using to fight the virus. They could save many thousands of lives in China. Only the government knows if it has enough of them to go around. If not, it should start stocking up. Foreign governments would surely send supplies if China asked. President Xi Jinping should not let his pride imperil China’s people, as he has done by shunning more efficacious Western vaccines. China’s vaccines still work. So the third priority is to get them into people’s arms. It may be too late for many in this wave, but there will be others. Less than half of those over 80 years old have had three shots, the number needed for decent protection against severe disease and death. Yet some of the elderly have gone to the clinic for a jab only to be turned away for lack of supplies. Until recently, some vaccine factories were sitting idle. Vast quantities will be needed. Six-monthly booster shots ought to become a normal part of life for older Chinese. As the state has failed to do its job, people are helping themselves. Masks are ubiquitous in many cities and more people are working from home. Restaurants and cinemas may be open, but in cities such as Beijing they remain largely empty. All this will help slow the growth of this covid wave and ease the pressure on hospitals. But the government must also act. In a country the size of China, even small steps could save many lives.""

Article: ""How Chinese people are dealing with the spread of covid-19 The government has left the public to fend for itself A elderly man wearing a face mask and goggle walks on a street in Beijing, Sunday, Dec. 11, 2022. Facing a surge in COVID-19 cases, China is setting up more intensive care facilities and trying to strengthen hospitals as Beijing rolls back anti-virus controls that confined millions of people to their homes, crushed economic growth and set off protests. Just a few months ago Chinese people had little fear of catching covid-19. The government’s “zero-covid” measures kept them safe for the most part. Mass testing and strict lockdowns contained the virus. If a person did test positive, the government would swoop in. The infected were taken to state-run quarantine centres. If symptomatic, they were treated in a designated hospital. Health workers would douse their house with disinfectant and test their neighbours. All this changed on December 7th, when the central government largely ditched its zero-covid policy, lifting most restrictions. Six days later it scrapped an app that tracked people’s movements. The highly transmissible Omicron variant had made zero-covid unsustainable. Now the public is expected to fend for itself. “Be the first person responsible for your own health,” wrote the People’s Daily, a Communist Party mouthpiece. Some residents of Beijing have received letters from the local committees that used to enforce covid controls. Stop reporting fevers and coughs to us, one read, before wishing people good luck. “Thank you for the past three years of support and understanding.” The official number of new cases is falling, as if the virus were fading away. But official numbers are no longer reliable because the government has scaled back testing. If it has an alternative way of keeping tabs on the epidemic, it is not sharing it. Still, it is pretty clear that a covid wave is building, as people share stories of infection online. An informal survey has been circulating on social media asking Beijing residents if they have caught the virus. As The Economist went to press, 39% of the 434,000 or so respondents had said yes. Such surveys are striking, not just for the numbers. A few months ago people who had caught covid were stigmatised. They might, for example, struggle to find jobs after recovering. Now the disease is so common that people are posting their test results on social media, often substituting for the word “positive” a cartoon of a sheep (which is a Chinese homophone for positive). Others are sharing lighthearted advice about the best time to catch covid. An infection now or in early January, for example, might clear up in time for a person to enjoy both Christmas and the lunar new year. “Why aren’t I positive yet?” complained one young woman in a video. Others, though, are worried. Until recently the government told people that covid was to be feared. Now the official line is that Omicron is no worse than the flu. Infected people who are not showing serious symptoms have been encouraged to stay at home and treat themselves. Not everyone is listening. Beijing’s emergency-call operators have been swamped by over 30,000 calls a day, about six times the average. Queues have appeared outside fever clinics in several cities. Certain medicines are in short supply. On December 13th a health-care website began selling Paxlovid, a highly effective antiviral drug used to treat covid. Its initial stocks sold out in half an hour. Hospitals are under more stress as doctors and nurses catch the virus. There are reports that some medical workers who have tested positive have been asked to come in anyway, risking more transmission within hospitals. As of December 13th Beijing had 50 severely ill patients, according to the official numbers. So far, the health system does not appear to be overwhelmed. But the peak of this wave is still some way off. It will probably come in late January, at least in Beijing, says Ben Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong. With the government changing its message, people are looking elsewhere for guidance. Overseas Chinese students who have experience with covid are sharing advice on WeChat, a social-media app. They tell people what symptoms to expect and how long they might last. In general, though, good information on the virus is lacking. There are reports of people going to hospital after taking too much fever medicine. Herbal remedies used to combat covid are in hot demand, though doctors doubt their effectiveness. Vaccines, not voodoo At least people now see the need to protect themselves against the virus, which was once viewed as a terrifying but distant threat. More are getting vaccinated. The number of jabs administered each day has increased from fewer than 200,000 to over 1m. But there is a lot of ground to make up, especially when it comes to the most vulnerable. Only around 40% of people over 80 have received the three doses needed to significantly reduce the chances of severe disease or death. Yet some elderly people have had trouble getting a shot because of a lack of supply at clinics. People are also taking steps that will help mitigate the spread of the disease and perhaps reduce the pressure on hospitals. In Beijing the shopping centres and streets are largely empty, as people stay inside. Call it a self-imposed lockdown. People who do venture out wear n95 masks (which are good at filtering small airborne particles). Demand for home deliveries of meals and groceries has shot up. But people are still making plans to travel back to their villages and home towns for the lunar new year in late January. Data from Ctrip, a booking platform, show that the volume of searches for flights has increased by 160% since the government loosened restrictions. Searches for train tickets on Baidu, a search engine, increased by nearly 600% during that time. Many rural areas are woefully unprepared to handle a surge in cases. When the peak of this wave approaches, “it would make a lot of sense to bring back some public-health measures,” says Mr Cowling.

Article: ""What China can still do to avoid an enormous covid death toll It must treat hospitals as a precious resource and start stockpiling drugs People wearing face masks walk in a subway station, as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks continue in Shanghai, China, December 8, 2022. Testing stations are being removed from city streets. The enforcers of “zero-covid” are nowhere to be found. In China’s battle against covid-19, the state has disappeared from the front lines. For nearly three years President Xi Jinping tried to contain the virus, calling his efforts a “people’s war”. Now he has surrendered and the people must live with the enemy. Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android. Mr Xi is not the first leader to conclude that such a fight was unwinnable. But before ditching their zero-covid policies, other countries first took pains to administer vaccines, stockpile antiviral drugs and draw up treatment guidelines. China had ample time to do all of that. Yet more than two years after the first vaccine proved effective, the country remains ill-prepared. That has made opening up much more dangerous than it ought to be. How dangerous? In this week’s China section we publish our model of how the epidemic might play out. It comes with essential caveats. Modelling an epidemic is difficult. Modelling one in China, where the data are often unreliable, is even harder. We take into account variables such as vaccination rates, the effectiveness of Chinese jabs, the lethality of covid for different age groups and the number of intensive-care beds. In a worst case, if covid spreads freely and many people cannot get care, we estimate that in the coming months 1.5m Chinese people will die from the virus. Although that is a lower share of the population than in many rich countries, it is still a criticism of the government’s poor preparations. It is also a call to action. A vaccination drive will take months. The government has waited too long to build and staff new icus. But even if the state will not impose lockdowns while it prepares, it can mitigate the number of deaths. It should start by protecting the health system. A wave of covid is breaking over China.

Article: ""What China can still do to avoid an enormous covid death toll It must treat hospitals as a precious resource and start stockpiling drugs People wearing face masks walk in a subway station, as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks continue in Shanghai, China, December 8, 2022. Testing stations are being removed from city streets. The enforcers of “zero-covid” are nowhere to be found. In China’s battle against covid-19, the state has disappeared from the front lines. For nearly three years President Xi Jinping tried to contain the virus, calling his efforts a “people’s war”. Now he has surrendered and the people must live with the enemy. Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android. Mr Xi is not the first leader to conclude that such a fight was unwinnable. But before ditching their zero-covid policies, other countries first took pains to administer vaccines, stockpile antiviral drugs and draw up treatment guidelines. China had ample time to do all of that. Yet more than two years after the first vaccine proved effective, the country remains ill-prepared. That has made opening up much more dangerous than it ought to be. How dangerous? In this week’s China section we publish our model of how the epidemic might play out. It comes with essential caveats. Modelling an epidemic is difficult. Modelling one in China, where the data are often unreliable, is even harder. We take into account variables such as vaccination rates, the effectiveness of Chinese jabs, the lethality of covid for different age groups and the number of intensive-care beds. In a worst case, if covid spreads freely and many people cannot get care, we estimate that in the coming months 1.5m Chinese people will die from the virus. Although that is a lower share of the population than in many rich countries, it is still a criticism of the government’s poor preparations. It is also a call to action. A vaccination drive will take months. The government has waited too long to build and staff new icus. But even if the state will not impose lockdowns while it prepares, it can mitigate the number of deaths. It should start by protecting the health system. A wave of covid is breaking over China. Our model sees this peaking in January. By that time hospitals risk being overwhelmed. Beds and staff are a precious resource to be husbanded. That means keeping people who are not seriously ill away from hospitals. To that end, the state could help drug companies restock pharmacies that run out of such things as lateral-flow tests and paracetamol. Medical staff should be vaccinated first and they must be given the proper gear to minimise the risk of infection. A second step is to ensure cheap and plentiful supplies of covid drugs. Dexamethasone, a low-priced steroid, has been shown to reduce deaths among the most severely ill patients. Antivirals, such as Paxlovid, help keep those most at risk out of hospital. These drugs have become part of the toolkit doctors around the world are using to fight the virus. They could save many thousands of lives in China. Only the government knows if it has enough of them to go around. If not, it should start stocking up. Foreign governments would surely send supplies if China asked. President Xi Jinping should not let his pride imperil China’s people, as he has done by shunning more efficacious Western vaccines. China’s vaccines still work. So the third priority is to get them into people’s arms. It may be too late for many in this wave, but there will be others. Less than half of those over 80 years old have had three shots, the number needed for decent protection against severe disease and death. Yet some of the elderly have gone to the clinic for a jab only to be turned away for lack of supplies. Until recently, some vaccine factories were sitting idle. Vast quantities will be needed. Six-monthly booster shots ought to become a normal part of life for older Chinese. As the state has failed to do its job, people are helping themselves. Masks are ubiquitous in many cities and more people are working from home. Restaurants and cinemas may be open, but in cities such as Beijing they remain largely empty. All this will help slow the growth of this covid wave and ease the pressure on hospitals. But the government must also act. In a country the size of China, even small steps could save many lives.""

Article: ""How Chinese people are dealing with the spread of covid-19 The government has left the public to fend for itself A elderly man wearing a face mask and goggle walks on a street in Beijing, Sunday, Dec. 11, 2022. Facing a surge in COVID-19 cases, China is setting up more intensive care facilities and trying to strengthen hospitals as Beijing rolls back anti-virus controls that confined millions of people to their homes, crushed economic growth and set off protests. Just a few months ago Chinese people had little fear of catching covid-19. The government’s “zero-covid” measures kept them safe for the most part. Mass testing and strict lockdowns contained the virus. If a person did test positive, the government would swoop in. The infected were taken to state-run quarantine centres. If symptomatic, they were treated in a designated hospital. Health workers would douse their house with disinfectant and test their neighbours. All this changed on December 7th, when the central government largely ditched its zero-covid policy, lifting most restrictions. Six days later it scrapped an app that tracked people’s movements. The highly transmissible Omicron variant had made zero-covid unsustainable. Now the public is expected to fend for itself. “Be the first person responsible for your own health,” wrote the People’s Daily, a Communist Party mouthpiece. Some residents of Beijing have received letters from the local committees that used to enforce covid controls. Stop reporting fevers and coughs to us, one read, before wishing people good luck. “Thank you for the past three years of support and understanding.” The official number of new cases is falling, as if the virus were fading away. But official numbers are no longer reliable because the government has scaled back testing. If it has an alternative way of keeping tabs on the epidemic, it is not sharing it. Still, it is pretty clear that a covid wave is building, as people share stories of infection online. An informal survey has been circulating on social media asking Beijing residents if they have caught the virus. As The Economist went to press, 39% of the 434,000 or so respondents had said yes. Such surveys are striking, not just for the numbers. A few months ago people who had caught covid were stigmatised. They might, for example, struggle to find jobs after recovering. Now the disease is so common that people are posting their test results on social media, often substituting for the word “positive” a cartoon of a sheep (which is a Chinese homophone for positive). Others are sharing lighthearted advice about the best time to catch covid. An infection now or in early January, for example, might clear up in time for a person to enjoy both Christmas and the lunar new year. “Why aren’t I positive yet?” complained one young woman in a video. Others, though, are worried. Until recently the government told people that covid was to be feared. Now the official line is that Omicron is no worse than the flu. Infected people who are not showing serious symptoms have been encouraged to stay at home and treat themselves. Not everyone is listening. Beijing’s emergency-call operators have been swamped by over 30,000 calls a day, about six times the average. Queues have appeared outside fever clinics in several cities. Certain medicines are in short supply. On December 13th a health-care website began selling Paxlovid, a highly effective antiviral drug used to treat covid. Its initial stocks sold out in half an hour. Hospitals are under more stress as doctors and nurses catch the virus. There are reports that some medical workers who have tested positive have been asked to come in anyway, risking more transmission within hospitals. As of December 13th Beijing had 50 severely ill patients, according to the official numbers. So far, the health system does not appear to be overwhelmed. But the peak of this wave is still some way off. It will probably come in late January, at least in Beijing, says Ben Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong. With the government changing its message, people are looking elsewhere for guidance. Overseas Chinese students who have experience with covid are sharing advice on WeChat, a social-media app. They tell people what symptoms to expect and how long they might last. In general, though, good information on the virus is lacking. There are reports of people going to hospital after taking too much fever medicine. Herbal remedies used to combat covid are in hot demand, though doctors doubt their effectiveness. Vaccines, not voodoo At least people now see the need to protect themselves against the virus, which was once viewed as a terrifying but distant threat. More are getting vaccinated. The number of jabs administered each day has increased from fewer than 200,000 to over 1m. But there is a lot of ground to make up, especially when it comes to the most vulnerable. Only around 40% of people over 80 have received the three doses needed to significantly reduce the chances of severe disease or death. Yet some elderly people have had trouble getting a shot because of a lack of supply at clinics. People are also taking steps that will help mitigate the spread of the disease and perhaps reduce the pressure on hospitals. In Beijing the shopping centres and streets are largely empty, as people stay inside. Call it a self-imposed lockdown. People who do venture out wear n95 masks (which are good at filtering small airborne particles). Demand for home deliveries of meals and groceries has shot up. But people are still making plans to travel back to their villages and home towns for the lunar new year in late January. Data from Ctrip, a booking platform, show that the volume of searches for flights has increased by 160% since the government loosened restrictions. Searches for train tickets on Baidu, a search engine, increased by nearly 600% during that time. Many rural areas are woefully unprepared to handle a surge in cases. When the peak of this wave approaches, “it would make a lot of sense to bring back some public-health measures,” says Mr Cowling. But reversing course may be hard for the government to justify without admitting that it had made a mistake."" From the article above, I find the following sentences most interesting: 1.

Beijing urges inoculations for elderly WHO calls for vaccine drive as virus spreads Economic summit starts amid more dire data BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Dec 15 (Reuters) - China raced to vaccinate its most vulnerable people on Thursday in anticipation of waves of COVID-19 infections, with some analysts expecting the death toll to soar after it eased strict controls that had kept the pandemic at bay for three years. The push comes as the World Health Organisation also raised concerns that China's 1.4 billion population was not adequately vaccinated and the United States offered help in dealing with a surge in infections. Beijing last Wednesday began dismantling its tough 'zero-COVID' controls, dropping testing requirements and easing quarantine rules that had caused anxiety for tens of millions and battered the world's second largest economy.

There are increasing signs of chaos during China's change of tack - including long queues outside fever clinics, runs on medicines and panic buying across the country. On Thursday night, China's state asset regulator urged state-backed big drugmakers to ensure supplies of COVID-related medicines. The companies include China Resources, China General Technology and Sinopharm, which own businesses that produce drugs that could ease coronavirus symptoms. One video posted online on Wednesday showed several people in thick winter clothes hooked up to intravenous drips as they sat on stools on the street outside a clinic in central Hubei province. Reuters verified the location of the video. The COVID scare in China also led people in Hong Kong, Macau and in some neighbourhoods in Australia to go in search for fever medicines and test kits for family and friends on the mainland. For all its efforts to quell the virus since it erupted in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, China may now pay a price for shielding a population that lacks ""herd immunity"" and has low vaccination rates among the elderly, analysts said.

""Upward of 1 million people could die from COVID in the coming months."" Other experts have put the potential toll at more than 2 million. China has reported just 5,235 COVID-related deaths so far, extremely low by global standards. China's stock markets and its currency fell on Thursday on concerns of the virus spread. China reported 2,000 new symptomatic COVID-19 infections for Dec. 14 compared with 2,291 a day. The official figures, however, have become less reliable as testing has dropped. It also stopped reporting asymptomatic figures on Wednesday. CONCERN FOR ELDERLY China, which has said around 90% of its population is vaccinated against COVID, has now decided to roll out the second booster shot for high-risk groups and elderly people over 60 years of age. National Health Commission spokesperson Mi Feng said on Wednesday it was necessary to accelerate the promotion of vaccinations, according to comments reported by state media. The latest official data shows China administered 1.43 million COVID shots on Tuesday, well above rates in November of around 100,000-200,000 doses a day. In total, it has administered 3.45 billion shots. Vaccinations in China have been ramping up in recent days.

The treatment, however, has only been available in hospitals for high-risk patients, but signs have appeared in recent days that it may soon be made more widely available. China Meheco Group Co Ltd's stock jumped (600056.SS) after it announced a deal to import the U.S. drugmaker's treatment on Wednesday. ECONOMIC CONFERENCE As the virus spreads, President Xi, his ruling Politburo and senior government officials began a two-day meeting to plot a recovery for China's battered economy, according to sources with knowledge of the matter. China's economy lost more steam in November as factory output growth slowed and retail sales extended declines, both missing forecasts and clocking their worst readings since May, data on Thursday showed. Economists estimate that China's growth has slowed to around 3% this year, marking one of China's worst performances in almost half a century.""

The treatment, however, has only been available in hospitals for high-risk patients, but signs have appeared in recent days that it may soon be made more widely available. China Meheco Group Co Ltd's stock jumped (600056.SS) after it announced a deal to import the U.S. drugmaker's treatment on Wednesday. ECONOMIC CONFERENCE As the virus spreads, President Xi, his ruling Politburo and senior government officials began a two-day meeting to plot a recovery for China's battered economy, according to sources with knowledge of the matter. China's economy lost more steam in November as factory output growth slowed and retail sales extended declines, both missing forecasts and clocking their worst readings since May, data on Thursday showed. Economists estimate that China's growth has slowed to around 3% this year, marking one of China's worst performances in almost half a century."" From the article above, I find the following sentences most interesting: 1. ""Upward of 1 million people could die from COVID in the coming months."" 2. ""Other experts have put the potential toll at more than 2 million."" 3. ""China administered 1.43 million COVID shots on Tuesday, well above rates in November of around 100,000-200,000 doses a day. In total, it has administered 3.45 billion shots.""",base,0.6580898163786277

I feel like a great use for this would be in the initial design phase. Like, imagine using AI to create 20 different prototypes to let a client choose from. That would take AGES manually, but just a few minutes in Midjourney. The client chooses one, and you have your starting point.

 @Vodoved  I’ve been doing freelance design for most of the last 25 years. I’ve found clients sometimes aren’t happy with just 2 or 3. I used to start with 2 mockups, but about 10% of clients wouldn’t like either and it was frustrating because all those mockups took time. Being able to do 5 or 10 or even 20 in less time than 1 used to take means a greater likelihood that the client will be happy with at least one of them.

 @SuperChaos  I mean, I wouldn’t do it automatically. Maybe offer 2-3 at first. Or 5, which is what I would offer as an option when I was doing book covers. (They’d have to pay more for 5 mockups than for 2.) But for a picky client (and there are lots of those) having more options that you don’t have to spend hours making would be a game changer.

I think NN-based image generators have the same issues like Behance and Dribble have - often it looks the same, follows a trend, can't create new things, don't have fresh ideas ... I  like more to incorporate ideas from other mediums, from old website styles (like 2010) or from websites from other parts of the world except western countries. 
The problem with that is, that once you got this suggestions (from an NN based generator) you are almost become captured by it and can't escape mentally for new ideas.

 @Mukomio  All AI relies on material fed to it. If it were to replace too many people then it will only have its own material to feed on, and become completely stagnant.

It's hype. Look at self driving cars.. hasn't taken off. The chess playing robot broke the kids hand lol. 

Plus people want to do business with people, not machines that can't communicate.

 @shrunkensimon  you don't have an understanding of how AI works. Creativity is just mixing stuff together, don't kid yourself. People you deem creative have experiences they put together to find new ways of building things. If you give the correct prompts, the AI can generate novelty the same way as people can.

 @ib0o0  A child can mix paints together on a canvas, doesn't mean it's going to be 'good' art. Someone with an understanding of musical notation can write a piano piece, doesn't mean it will sound 'good'.

AI has no conception of what works for humans, it has no lateral or emotive thinking.

Also creativity is not the same as imagination or inspiration.

It can create new things and it does create new things. The way it looks depends on what you tell it to spit out. Midjourney has some preset style, but you can tell it to look different. You'll have to specifiy what you want. You have really no idea what these image generators are capable of.

\textbf{General Comments (Non-linear ICA):} The smooth field cluster recovery problem can be reformulated as a non-linear independent component analysis (ICA) problem. %in terms of several other learning problems. In particular we consider reformulating as a non-linear independent component analysis (ICA) problem and as a deconvolution problem.
In the mixing framework provided by non-linear ICA~\cite{Zheng22,Hyvarinen99}, the data generating process of observation $y$ is assumed to follow
\begin{align}
p_s(s) &amp;= \prod_{i=1}^n p_{s_i}(s_i)\label{eq:p_marg}\\
y &amp;= \psi(s)\label{eq:psi_transf},
\end{align}
where $p_{s_i}$ are marginally, independent distributions over latent sources $s_i$ and $\psi$ is a non-linear mixing function over the reals.

In connection to smooth field cluster problems, we may consider %a specific instance 
%of the clustering problem 
an instance of non-linear ICA where sources $s_i = (x_i, \tilde{z}_i)$ have an observed part $x_i$ and a latent part $\tilde z_i$, and are generated as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dgp}
    x_i \overset{iid}{\sim} P, \quad\tilde{z}_i \overset{iid}{\sim} {\rm Unif}[0,1)
\end{equation}
for some sampling distribution $P$. To create a simple smooth field cluster problem, consider the mixing function
\begin{equation}\label{eq:indep_clust}
    \psi(x_i, \tilde{z}_i) = f(x_i) + \mu (\phi(\tilde{z}_i))\qquad{\rm with}\qquad \phi(\tilde{z}_i) = \lfloor \tilde{z}_i \cdot M \rfloor + 1,
\end{equation}
where $f$ is uniformly continuous and $\mu : [M]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a finite set of levels. The key here is that although $f$ is smooth, the overall $\psi$ is not; it is in fact discontinuous due to $\phi(\cdot)$.

Identifiability conditions for~(\ref{eq:p_marg}-\ref{eq:psi_transf}) have been detailed for cases where $\psi$ satisfies particular regularity conditions such as: injectivity, differentiability, smoothness, and smoothness of inverse~\cite{Zheng22,Hyvarinen19,Lachapelle22,Khemakhem20}. In contrast for the smooth field clustering problem, even for a simplified generative case (\ref{eq:dgp}-\ref{eq:indep_clust}), the mixing function $\psi$ is neither guaranteed to be injective nor continuous for $(x,z) \in {\rm supp}(P)^n\times[0,1)^n$. 

Theoretical results pertaining to non-linear ICA are generally concerned with the identifiability of the problem~\cite{Zheng22,Hyvarinen99,Hyvarinen19,Lachapelle22,Khemakhem20}. Under the lens of non-linear ICA, our work on smooth field clustering provides another identifiability result in the case where the mixing function $\psi$ is missing substantial regularity. Furthermore the viewpoint provided by the smooth field clustering is free from any generative framework and can work in a completely deterministic setting.

We note that~\eqref{eq:indep_clust} is a \textit{self}-mixing example with coordinate-wise independence, $\psi(x, \tilde{z}) = (\psi(x_i, \tilde{z_i}))_{i=1}^n$. In the general case, we may consider a more complicated classification map $\phi$, where $\phi$ now depends on all latent positions %$((x_1,\ldots,x_n),(\tilde{z}_1,\ldots,\tilde{z}_n))$. 
$(\tilde{z}_1,\ldots,\tilde{z}_n)$.
These more complicated $\phi$ are not restricted to self-mixing and could be used to encode correlated cluster information, without affecting the independence of latent sources. The example we gave above was deliberately simple to emphasize the potential discontinuous nature of the map $\psi$. %(this would not affect the independence latent sources).",none,0.3764211053342354

"Can you write a Java program to solve this Problem Statement (called ""NoOrderOfOperations"") ?

Problem Statement

When evaluating a mathematical expression, there is the possibility of ambiguity. If you wanted to know the result of ""3 + 5 * 7"", you might first evaluate the (3+5) and get 56, or first evaluate the (5*7) and get 38. This ambiguity can be resolved by using the order of operations: first do multiplication and division (from left to right), and then after all those are done, do addition and subtraction (again from left to right). Here, the correct result would be the 38.
While this is unambiguous, it certainly is somewhat annoying. You think it would be easier if people did all math from left to right, all the time, and want to make a simple expression evaluator to do so.
The expression will be given to you as a String expr. It will consist of one digit numbers (0 through 9) alternating with operators (+, -, or *), with no spaces between them. Thus, expr would follow the format Digit Operator Digit Operator .... Digit. For example, the expression given above would be given as ""3+5*7"".
Your method should return an int representing the value of the expression when evaluated from left to right.

The Method signature should be	""int evaluate(String expr)""
	
Constraints:
-	expr will be between 1 and 17 characters in length, inclusive.
-	expr will contain an odd number of characters.
-	expr will follow the format Digit Operator Digit Operator ... Digit, where each Digit is a single character from '0' to '9', and each Operator is either +, -, or *.

Examples
0)	""3+5*7""	

Returns: 56

"Challenge description:
Increased bridging activity over the past year has led to multiple bridge solutions to accommodate users hopping across chains. While this introduced a slew of routes, it also added a layer of uncertainty around which one to pick. Bridge aggregators curate this for you and take the extra guesswork out of the equation. Instead of having to find multiple bridges, you can just use bridge aggregators to source the best route depending on where you want to go and what you want to bring with you.

Using the various bridge SDKs and protocols, write a bridge aggregator for the different bridges that work with Algorand. The submission should provide a unified UI or SDK where the user specifies where they are starting and where they want to go and then handle the transaction for the user. Right now, the primary bridges with Algorand support are

Glitter: https://portal.glitterfinance.org/developer-tools

Wormhole: https://book.wormhole.com/technical/algorand/overview.html

The submission should be written in a way that would support other bridges as they get released.

Submission Requirements
A valid submission will include the source code via a Github repository linked to your Gitcoin submission, a recorded demo and an article that explains how the application works. It is expected that most bounty challenges will be won by fully functioning submissions, however, in certain cases, where there is a higher degree of difficulty, projects and payouts will be assessed on progress made. The project submission deadline is 17:00 EST on February 8, 2023.

Judging Criteria
Four judges from The Algorand Foundation will also assess each project submission by February 19, 2023. The following criteria will be used to assess projects: IMPACT &amp; USEFULNESS: How impactful and useful the submission is in the Algorand ecosystem as a whole ORIGINALITY, CREATIVITY &amp; INNOVATION: How new and novel the submission is versus existing technologies MASS USABILITY: How feasible is the idea &amp; how adaptable is it across other integrations TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY: What is the level of skill or knowledge required to build the submission CLARITY: How clear or easily understood the documentation, examples and pitch video is TEAM DIVERSITY: How diverse are the team’s skill sets &amp; what is the quality of the team formation

Winner Announcement Date
Winners will be announced on February 25, 2023, with payouts to be completed no more than one week thereafter.

"Create a 2000 words conversational article news and Rephrase this with 100% no plagiarism and unique Microsoft is preparing to launch a new version of Microsoft Teams next month that has been rebuilt from the ground up to significantly improve its system resource usage on PCs and laptops. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell The Verge that the software giant has recently started testing this new Teams client broadly inside Microsoft, with plans to roll out a preview to Microsoft Teams users in March.

Known as Microsoft Teams 2.0 or 2.1 internally, Microsoft has been working on this new Teams client for years. The app should use 50 percent less memory, tax the CPU less, and result in better battery life on laptops.

While Microsoft shipped some of this early work in the built-in Teams experience for consumers in Windows 11, businesses running Teams have been using the older Teams client due to the amount of work involved for Microsoft to rebuild the client. This new app moves Teams away from Electron and to Microsoft’s Edge Webview2 technology. Microsoft has also moved to React, a Javascript library, that will offer further UI improvements for Teams in the coming months.
In a Twitter thread detailing the initial Microsoft Teams improvements for Windows 11 in 2021, former head of Microsoft Teams engineering Rish Tandon said Microsoft’s new architecture will be key for future Teams improvements. “This architecture will help us add support for multiple accounts, work life scenarios, release predictability, and scale up for the client,” said Tandon. “It will be a journey but with Windows 11 we have taken key first steps.”

The improvements should mean Teams opens a lot faster or feels more responsive when you’re presenting in a meeting or responding to messages. The new Teams app should address many of the criticisms and complaints around Teams performance, particularly on older laptops.

Microsoft is currently planning to ship a preview of its new app to Teams users in late March, which includes a toggle to switch back to the existing app if need be.
Microsoft Teams has become one of the most important software products for the company in the past several years. Now, it looks like Teams is going to get a major app internal revamp that should make it easier to use. The Verge is reporting, via unnamed sources, that this new version, which has been called Teams 2.0 or 2.1 internally at Microsoft, will be released to the public in a preview edition in late March 2023.

While the Teams development team have released updates to the current client that contain smaller performance increases, including one in late 2022, this new Teams app will allegedly have some big improvements in terms of the hardware resources it will take up on PCs. The story reports that it will use 50 percent less memory, and will also have better CPU performance, although it's unclear how big of an improvement Teams will get in that area. The new client will also reportedly give laptops an unnamed boost in battery life when in use. In short, the new Teams will reportedly launch faster, and work better, especially on older desktops and laptops.

All of these big increases in performance is reportedly due to moving Teams from the old Electron platform to the more recent Microsoft Edge WebView2. The story adds that the new Teams will also use the Javascript-based library React, which will allow Microsoft developers to put in UI improvements in the client. Those improvements will be added sometime in the coming months.

If, for some reason, the upcoming preview version of Teams doesn't work, the story says there will be a toggle that will allow users to switch between the current and new versions. There's no word on how long Microsoft plans to wait until Teams 2.0 becomes the default version.",none,0.6897390214135243

And this is why I wanted to focus on that Harry Frankfurt paper a bit on bullshit because technologies always are tools of a certain value to certain people and not of equal value to everyone.

And a system that’s very good at creating stylistically flexible content, but does not have a sense of internal understanding or morality or truthfulness just is going to be very good for people, all kinds of people, for whom the point is not the truthfulness of the content. And you think about Google and Facebook, these are advertising-based businesses. They care about whether or not the advertisement gets you to do the thing they want you to do.

And so just in terms of what has, I think, ruined a lot of the internet, which is just how much of the content is there not because it’s there for you or to be accurate or even to be enjoyed, but is there to just try to get you to do something that you didn’t even realize anybody was trying to get you to do. Like you thought you were there sharing stuff, but actually your dad is being sold to advertisers so they can get you to buy stuff.

It just seems like an incredible set of technologies for a part of the economy that I don’t really want to see become 10X better and have their costs fall to functionally zero.

GARY MARCUS: The dirty secret of large language models is that most of the revenue right now comes from search engine optimization. So there are companies like Jasper.ai that are mostly, as far as I can tell — this is really word of mouth so I can’t quite prove it — but they’re reportedly mainly used to optimize where something lands in a search. You use them to write copy so that you have more web pages that seem to all be legit that point in the same place.

There’s an example — I don’t know if it was written by Jasper or GPT-3 or not — but I think it’s an example of the kind of thing we’re going to see to come where there’s a whole ring of websites, like 20 or 30 of them, about Mayim Bialik selling C.B.D. gummies. Turns out the whole thing is a hoax. She’s not selling C.B.D. gummies.

And so you could ask, why does this thing exist? And I don’t know for sure, but I think we’ll see more of them. And my guess is that these circles of fake websites exist to sell ads, which goes back to exactly what you’re talking about.

So you wind up on this site because it sounds interesting. Really, she’s selling C.B.D. gummies? And then while you’re there you click an ad, and then they make some money from something that’s totally bogus. Well, with these tools like ChatGPT and so forth, especially GPT-3, it’s going to be very easy to make 10, 20, 30, 40 websites that reinforce each other and give the air of legitimacy. And maybe you do this just to sell ads.

I think the technical term for this is a click farm. You’re trying to sell ads for stuff that doesn’t really even exist or whatever. You’re trying to sell ads around, maybe, fake medical information. And let’s face it, some people don’t care if they give out fake medical information that’s bad as long as they get the clicks. And we are leaning towards that dark world.

It’s also a problem for the search engines themselves. They don’t want to get caught placing ads on fake websites, but that has happened. There was a ProPublica investigation about — Google got into a situation like that. So we have a whole almost like shadow economy that’s really about selling ads, sometimes with altogether fake websites or trying to prop up the websites so that the search engines see them more. It’s a big piece — I don’t know how big a piece — but it’s a significant piece of the economy exists just to sell you ads by tinkering with the mechanics of the whole system. And these large language models are going to contribute to that.

"Explain my dream in a Freudian analysis. To you give context before I talk about my dream, I use to work at two different cold-calling sales jobs.

The second I was put on a performance plan to make quota within 60 days. If I didn't make quota within that timeframe I would lose my job, I ended up quitting anyways before that time. When I finally left that job for one that I really liked and was good at, I was happy and on cloud 9. Now the last time I worked a cold-calling sales jobs was three years. However last night I had a nightmare that I was working that type of job again and I was still really bad at it, it was a huge blow to my self-esteem and ego, it made me feel like I had downgraded in life.

As an owner of ForgeFX please help me write a response to this request for proposal: ""23-NH2: Immersive Virtual Reality Training on Impaired Driving for Law Enforcement.
NHTSA is interested in the development of new training tools that can support the agency’s continuing 
efforts to provide law enforcement professionals the necessary training resources to identify and 
remove impaired drivers from our nations’ roadways. Preliminary estimates show roadway deaths 
climbing to 42,915 in 2021, a 16 year high. Every day, about 32 people in the United States die in 
drunk-driving 9 crashes — that's one person every 45 minutes. In 2020, 11,654 people died in alcohol-
impaired driving traffic deaths — a 14% increase from 2019 (NHTSA Media, 2022). 
The ability of law enforcement to identify impaired drivers is a critical component to reducing fatalities 
involving alcohol and/or drug impairment. Impaired driving is a human factor that must be addressed 
to overcome the vision zero challenge to eliminate all fatalities and serious injuries on our nations’ 
roadways. This aligns with DOT’s Strategic Goal of Safety. The effects of alcohol on an individual have 
been researched extensively and law enforcement are trained to identify signs and symptoms 
associated with alcohol impairment through the basic Standardized Field Sobriety Testing curriculum, 
often included in the basic police academy/certification course. Law enforcement officials may later 
receive advanced training in the identification of impairment through the 16-hour Advanced Roadside 
Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) curriculum provided through the Drug Evaluation and 
Classification Program (DECP). Due to the complexity that comes with drug use and impairment, ARIDE
is designed to introduce law enforcement officers to the identification of signs and symptoms 
associated with impairment from drugs other than (or in addition to) alcohol. The ARIDE curriculum 
also identifies the practical use of a Drug Recognition Expert, post-arrest, in Driving Under the 
Influence of Drugs (DUID) cases. 
There is a need to make impaired driving training as realistic as practical so law enforcement can 
ensure they are identifying and apprehending impaired drivers’ roadside. There are limitations and 
legitimate concerns (such as liability and harm) with dosing live individuals with impairing substances 
for the purpose of curriculum development. This project aims to reduce unnecessary risks of harm to 
individuals. Additionally, we aim to reduce monetary costs and time involved in dosing individuals for 
the purpose of training. 
This topic aims to develop a course structure and technological approach for the purposes of training 
law enforcement on the behaviors associated with impaired driving. To achieve this, it is expected that
subject matter expertise in the areas of drug-impaired driving enforcement will inform the training 
approach and material. Ideally, these subject matter experts (SMEs) should be drug recognition 
experts (DRE); drug recognition expert instructors; or drug recognition expert state coordinators who 
are familiar with the content and application of the DECP. The proposal should explain when this 
expertise will be introduced into the project and, when possible, by whom. 
Expected Phase I Outcomes 
Expected outcomes for the conclusion of Phase I are a “Proof of Concept” Final Report which presents 
a course design for the interactive training technology and describes the technological approach and 
software and hardware requirements. The project should also produce a detailed plan for the 
development of the software files for a wide variety of virtual drivers (varying by age, gender, race, 
ethnicity) that can be displayed as under the influence of various impairing drugs, combinations of 
drugs, and control subjects. Finally, the project outcomes must include the identification of 
qualifications required (i.e., DRE Instructor) to proctor the use of the interactive training technology. A 
proctoring instructor should be well versed in the field of DUID and current DUID curricula used to train
law enforcement nationwide. 
Expected Phase II Outcomes 
Conditional on the outcomes of Phase I, Phase II will begin development of a market ready device for 
use by law enforcement officers. This device will be tested using the development plan developed in """,none,0.7106456623619699

the purpose of training. 
This topic aims to develop a course structure and technological approach for the purposes of training 
law enforcement on the behaviors associated with impaired driving. To achieve this, it is expected that
subject matter expertise in the areas of drug-impaired driving enforcement will inform the training 
approach and material. Ideally, these subject matter experts (SMEs) should be drug recognition 
experts (DRE); drug recognition expert instructors; or drug recognition expert state coordinators who 
are familiar with the content and application of the DECP. The proposal should explain when this 
expertise will be introduced into the project and, when possible, by whom. 
Expected Phase I Outcomes 
Expected outcomes for the conclusion of Phase I are a “Proof of Concept” Final Report which presents 
a course design for the interactive training technology and describes the technological approach and 
software and hardware requirements. The project should also produce a detailed plan for the 
development of the software files for a wide variety of virtual drivers (varying by age, gender, race, 
ethnicity) that can be displayed as under the influence of various impairing drugs, combinations of 
drugs, and control subjects. Finally, the project outcomes must include the identification of 
qualifications required (i.e., DRE Instructor) to proctor the use of the interactive training technology. A 
proctoring instructor should be well versed in the field of DUID and current DUID curricula used to train
law enforcement nationwide. 
Expected Phase II Outcomes 
Conditional on the outcomes of Phase I, Phase II will begin development of a market ready device for 
use by law enforcement officers. This device will be tested using the development plan developed in """,base,0.7416827524020096

Over the past three decades, a handful of products like Netscape’s web browser, Google’s search engine and Apple’s iPhone have truly upended the tech industry and made what came before them look like lumbering dinosaurs.
Three weeks ago, an experimental chat bot called ChatGPT made its case to be the industry’s next big disrupter. It can serve up information in clear, simple sentences, rather than just a list of internet links. It can explain concepts in ways people can easily understand. It can even generate ideas from scratch, including business strategies, Christmas gift suggestions, blog topics and vacation plans.
Although ChatGPT still has plenty of room for improvement, its release led Google’s management to declare a “code red.” For Google, this was akin to pulling the fire alarm. Some fear the company may be approaching a moment that the biggest Silicon Valley outfits dread — the arrival of an enormous technological change that could upend the business.
For more than 20 years, the Google search engine has served as the world’s primary gateway to the internet. But with a new kind of chat bot technology poised to reinvent or even replace traditional search engines, Google could face the first serious threat to its main search business. One Google executive described the efforts as make or break for Google’s future.
ChatGPT was released by an aggressive research lab called OpenAI, and Google is among the many other companies, labs and researchers that have helped build this technology. But experts believe the tech giant could struggle to compete with the newer, smaller companies developing these chat bots, because of the many ways the technology could damage its business.
Google has spent several years working on chat bots and, like other big tech companies, has aggressively pursued artificial intelligence technology. Google has already built a chat bot that could rival ChatGPT. In fact, the technology at the heart of OpenAI’s chat bot was developed by researchers at Google.
Called LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications, Google’s chat bot received enormous attention in the summer when a Google engineer, Blake Lemoine, claimed it was sentient. This was not true, but the technology showed how much chat bot technology had improved in recent months.
Google may be reluctant to deploy this new tech as a replacement for online search, however, because it is not suited to delivering digital ads, which accounted for more than 80 percent of the company’s revenue last year.
“No company is invincible; all are vulnerable,” said Margaret O’Mara, a professor at the University of Washington who specializes in the history of Silicon Valley. “For companies that have become extraordinarily successful doing one market-defining thing, it is hard to have a second act with something entirely different.”
Because these new chat bots learn their skills by analyzing huge amounts of data posted to the internet, they have a way of blending fiction with fact. They deliver information that can be biased against women and people of color. They can generate toxic language, including hate speech.
All of that could turn people against Google and damage the corporate brand it has spent decades building. As OpenAI has shown, newer companies may be more willing to take their chances with complaints in exchange for growth.
Even if Google perfects chat bots, it must tackle another issue: Does this technology cannibalize the company’s lucrative search ads? If a chat bot is responding to queries with tight sentences, there is less reason for people to click on advertising links.
“Google has a business model issue,” said Amr Awadallah, who worked for Yahoo and Google and now runs Vectara, a start-up that is building similar technology. “If Google gives you the perfect answer to each query, you won’t click on any ads.”
Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, has been involved in a series of meetings to define Google’s A.I. strategy, and he has upended the work of numerous groups inside the company to respond to the threat that ChatGPT poses, according to a memo and audio recording obtained by The New York Times. Employees have also been tasked with building A.I. products that can create artwork and other images, like OpenAI’s DALL-E technology, which has been used by more than three million people.
From now until a major conference expected to be hosted by Google in May, teams within Google’s research, Trust and Safety, and other departments have been reassigned to help develop and release new A.I. prototypes and products.
As the technology advances, industry experts believe, Google must decide whether it will overhaul its search engine and make a full-fledged chat bot the face of its flagship service.
Google has been reluctant to share its technology broadly because, like ChatGPT and similar systems, it can generate false, toxic and biased information. LaMDA is available to only a limited number of people through an experimental app, AI Test Kitchen.
Google sees this as a struggle to deploy its advanced A.I. without harming users or society, according to a memo viewed by The Times. In one recent meeting, a manager acknowledged that smaller companies had fewer concerns about releasing these tools, but said Google must wade into the fray or the industry could move on without it, according to an audio recording of the meeting obtained by The Times.
Other companies have a similar problem. Five years ago, Microsoft released a chat bot, called Tay, that spewed racist, xenophobic and otherwise filthy language and was forced to immediately remove it from the internet — never to return. In recent weeks, Meta took down a newer chat bot for many of the same reasons.
Executives said in the recorded meeting that Google intended to release the technology that drove its chat bot as a cloud computing service for outside businesses, and that it might incorporate the technology into simple customer support tasks. It will maintain its trust and safety standards for official products, but it will also release prototypes that do not meet those standards.
It may limit those prototypes to 500,000 users and warn them that the technology could produce false or offensive statements. Since its release on the last day of November, ChatGPT — which can produce similarly toxic material — has been used by over a million people.
“A cool demo of a conversational system that people can interact with over a few rounds, and it feels mind-blowing? That is a good step, but it is not the thing that will really transform society,” Zoubin Ghahramani, who oversees the A.I. lab Google Brain, said in an interview with The Times last month, before ChatGPT was released. “It is not something that people can use reliably on a daily basis.”
Google has already been working to enhance its search engine using the same technology that underpins chat bots like LaMDA and ChatGPT. The technology — a “large language model” — is not merely a way for machines to carry on a conversation.
Today, this technology helps the Google search engine highlight results that aim to directly answer a question you have asked. In the past, if you typed “Do aestheticians stand a lot at work?” into Google, it did not understand what you were asking. Now, Google correctly responds with a short blurb describing the physical demands of life in the skin care industry.
Many experts believe Google will continue to take this approach, incrementally improving its search engine rather than overhauling it. “Google Search is fairly conservative,” said Margaret Mitchell, who was an A.I. researcher at Microsoft and Google, where she helped to start its Ethical A.I. team, and is now at the research lab Hugging Face. “It tries not to mess up a system that works.”
Other companies, including Vectara and a search engine called Neeva, are working to enhance search technology in similar ways. But as OpenAI and other companies improve their chat bots — working to solve problems with toxicity and bias — this could become a viable replacement for today’s search engines. Whoever gets there first could be the winner.
“Last year, I was despondent that it was so hard to dislodge the iron grip of Google,” said Sridhar Ramaswamy, who previously oversaw advertising for Google, including Search ads, and now runs Neeva. “But technological moments like this create an opportunity for more competition.”",none,0.20490548435129677

Today, this technology helps the Google search engine highlight results that aim to directly answer a question you have asked. In the past, if you typed “Do aestheticians stand a lot at work?” into Google, it did not understand what you were asking. Now, Google correctly responds with a short blurb describing the physical demands of life in the skin care industry.
Many experts believe Google will continue to take this approach, incrementally improving its search engine rather than overhauling it. “Google Search is fairly conservative,” said Margaret Mitchell, who was an A.I. researcher at Microsoft and Google, where she helped to start its Ethical A.I. team, and is now at the research lab Hugging Face. “It tries not to mess up a system that works.”
Other companies, including Vectara and a search engine called Neeva, are working to enhance search technology in similar ways. But as OpenAI and other companies improve their chat bots — working to solve problems with toxicity and bias — this could become a viable replacement for today’s search engines. Whoever gets there first could be the winner.
“Last year, I was despondent that it was so hard to dislodge the iron grip of Google,” said Sridhar Ramaswamy, who previously oversaw advertising for Google, including Search ads, and now runs Neeva. “But technological moments like this create an opportunity for more competition.”",base,0.18933969655736352

Pip require hashes &amp; secure scaffold

Not sure if people remember (or if others have realised previously the workaround for this!) but here's the background:
* To harden Python against supply chain attacks, Google security recommends using requirements.txt files with hashes
* Then, using pip install --require-hashes will refuse to install any dependency which doesn't have hashes or the hash doesn't match what's downloaded
* For Google projects, we use the Secure Scaffold - https://github.com/google/gae-secure-scaffold-python3/
* If you install from a git branch/commit directly, pip doesn't calculate a hash e.g. in Poetry:
  secure-scaffold = { git = ""https://github.com/google/gae-secure-scaffold-python3.git"", branch = ""master"" }
* Therefore, we were unable to use --require-hashes for any service using Secure Scaffold

Talking with David (an ATL) recently, he pointed out that pip will add hashes if you install from an archive e.g. in Poetry:
  secure-scaffold = {url = ""https://github.com/google/gae-secure-scaffold-python3/archive/refs/tags/1.1.0.zip""}

The downside to this is that poetry update won't update this dependency (where it will for Pypi based dependencies, assuming you specify they as e.g. &gt;=1.4.2) - but security feel the upside (of being able to use --require-hashes) is worth it.

FYI @John Carter as IIRC it was you who originally found that secure scaffold didn't work with --require-hashes

John Carter, 10 Mar, 19:20
Cheers. Would be great if they released package updates for secure scaffold, rather than rely on install from master, but I guess they have their reasons not to.

FYI @Victor Fung

Nick Lee, 10 Mar, 19:25, Edited
Ah, I actually asked David &amp; he did a new tag (1.1.0; last one was I think 1.0.0 from over a year ago)

He seemed to think referencing archive of a commit hash was ok (I don't like it, but it is useful to have the require-hashes)

FYI, I just tried actually running the server locally (previously only ran tests &amp; deployed [which all work]) &amp; it gave this error:ERROR: In --require-hashes mode, all requirements must have their versions pinned with ==. These do not:
    gunicorn from https://files.pythonhosted.org/...
I'm guessing that dev_appserver adds gunicorn dep (if it's not there) without hashes, then sees that there are hashes so uses --require-hashes, which makes pip fail.

Workaround is to include gunicorn (with hashes) in your requirements.txt (it was there previously but I took it out &amp; ""everything"" still worked; I'm adding it back with a comment about why it's needed).

John Carter, 10 Mar, 19:27
Yeah it's ok if you don't want people to ever upgrade 🙄

FYI, I just tried actually running the server locally (previously only ran tests &amp; deployed [which all work]) &amp; it gave this error:ERROR: In --require-hashes mode, all requirements must have their versions pinned with ==. These do not:
    gunicorn from https://files.pythonhosted.org/...
I'm guessing that dev_appserver adds gunicorn dep (if it's not there) without hashes, then sees that there are hashes so uses --require-hashes, which makes pip fail.

Workaround is to include gunicorn (with hashes) in your requirements.txt (it was there previously but I took it out &amp; ""everything"" still worked; I'm adding it back with a comment about why it's needed).

"Here is a chat thread about a technical issue. Please cleanly extract the simplified question along with the correct answer. Do not try and summarise the entire thread. Only extract a minimal question and answer.

Pip require hashes &amp; secure scaffold

Not sure if people remember (or if others have realised previously the workaround for this!) but here's the background:
* To harden Python against supply chain attacks, Google security recommends using requirements.txt files with hashes
* Then, using pip install --require-hashes will refuse to install any dependency which doesn't have hashes or the hash doesn't match what's downloaded
* For Google projects, we use the Secure Scaffold - https://github.com/google/gae-secure-scaffold-python3/
* If you install from a git branch/commit directly, pip doesn't calculate a hash e.g. in Poetry:
  secure-scaffold = { git = ""https://github.com/google/gae-secure-scaffold-python3.git"", branch = ""master"" }
* Therefore, we were unable to use --require-hashes for any service using Secure Scaffold

Talking with David (an ATL) recently, he pointed out that pip will add hashes if you install from an archive e.g. in Poetry:
  secure-scaffold = {url = ""https://github.com/google/gae-secure-scaffold-python3/archive/refs/tags/1.1.0.zip""}

The downside to this is that poetry update won't update this dependency (where it will for Pypi based dependencies, assuming you specify they as e.g. &gt;=1.4.2) - but security feel the upside (of being able to use --require-hashes) is worth it.

FYI @John Carter as IIRC it was you who originally found that secure scaffold didn't work with --require-hashes

John Carter, 10 Mar, 19:20
Cheers. Would be great if they released package updates for secure scaffold, rather than rely on install from master, but I guess they have their reasons not to.

FYI @Victor Fung

"Hey Assistant, I need your help creating Midjourney command for AI Art Suffixes. 
 
The command for this kind of suffix should be in this format.

This formatting is taking advantage of Midjourney's multi-prompt functionality. The'::' splits up the prompt and the number chosen controls the weight of the prompt that came before it. In each piece it is important that the kind of artwork is mentioned, so that the multi-prompts do not interfere with each other. Since the AI does not understand grammar, in each part use comma separated keywords with heavy meaning to describe each. 
 
For example:
`/prefer option set option:impressionist value: - beautiful impressionist painting::5 dramatic oil painting, sweeping, expressive swirling strokes::4 painting, swirling impasto, thick brushes, pallet knife, strong creative choices, obvious brush marks::3 painted with saturated, epic colors, highly visual, rule of thirds::3 dull, boring, and ugly artwork::-2`

"Hey Assistant, I need your help creating Midjourney command for AI Art Suffixes. 
 
The command for this kind of suffix should be in this format.
 
`/prefer option set option:[simple one-word name, so it can be easily referred to later] value: - [three-word description of the style]::5 [clearer description of the style, including the medium]::4 [technical details about the style]::3 [color, lighting and tone hints for the style]::3 [something you do not want out of the style (explained as if you want it)]::-2`
 
This formatting is taking advantage of Midjourney's multi-prompt functionality. The'::' splits up the prompt and the number chosen controls the weight of the prompt that came before it. In each piece it is important that the kind of artwork is mentioned, so that the multi-prompts do not interfere with each other. Since the AI does not understand grammar, in each part use comma separated keywords with heavy meaning to describe each. 
 
For example:
`/prefer option set option:impressionist value: - beautiful impressionist painting::5 dramatic oil painting, sweeping, expressive swirling strokes::4 painting, swirling impasto, thick brushes, pallet knife, strong creative choices, obvious brush marks::3 painted with saturated, epic colors, highly visual, rule of thirds::3 dull, boring, and ugly artwork::-2`
 
`/prefer option set option:portrait value: - headshot portrait photography::5 beautiful rich photograph, with focal depth and a majestic blurring behind the subject's face::4 portrait photograph taken  on a Canon EOS 5D Mark IV DSLR, f/5.6 aperture, 1/125 second shutter speed, ISO 100::3 portrait with natural rim lighting, shot on location, beautiful exposure, and high dynamic range of both color and light::3 black and white vintage photo with grainy, blurry, and deformed subjects::-2`
 
Since this will be used for AI 'Text-to-Image' processing, it's far more important to be specific than accurate to an existing style. Make bold and interesting choices when you invent your own art style.
 
Please start by describing a visually appealing art style with clear detail so someone would be inspired to try the command. (Write in the format of persuasive ad copy) Then provide the command itself (as a code block so it can be easily copy and pasted). Repeat this task for three tries based on the following specification:
 
I would like three options for creating epic fantasy landscapes. Please create aerial, kingdom, and natural.

Now could you help me create Midjourney commands for generating artworks with those styles (--aerial, --kingdom, and --natural)
Format:

"Hey, i am imagining a game:


The game is played with a deck of role cards and a supply of coins and gems.

Game play: 

Players take turns performing one of the following actions:
Take one coin from the supply.
Use a gem power (described below).
Use the market (described below).
Perform the ability of their role.
When using role abilities, players are supposed to only perform the ability of their role. However, they may lie and pretend to be any role they wish.

If a player is challenged on their role by another player and caught bluffing, they must pay a penalty of 2 coins to that player and draw a new role. If the challenge is wrong, the challenging player pays the penalty.
If a player does not have enough coins to pay the penalty, they must immediately sell a gem to pay it.

The game ends when a player has collected a gem of each color. That player is the winner.
List of role abilities:

Exchange the gems between any 2 players.
Draw a role card from the deck and choose to swap current role with it.
Steal 2 coins from another player.
Change the color of one of your gems
Collect 3 coins while every other player collects 1 coin.
Gem abilities:

Black gem: Draw and reveal a role card from the deck, perform that role’s ability, then shuffle the card back into the deck
Green gem: Gain 2 coins.
Red gem:  Force another player to discard their role and draw a new one.
Purple gem: Force a player to sell their gem
Yellow gem: Buy a gem for 3 coins.

List of market trades:

Sell a gem of your choice for 3 coins.
Buy a gem of your choice for 5 coins.
Take an opponent's gem for 7 coins.
Discard your current role and draw a new one for 1 coin.
Look at another player’s role card for 2 coins.


Can you suggest themes that might be satisfying or interesting for a game like this?",none,0.8739443082199808

"Hi ChatGPT! I'm investigating how good an LLM would be in understanding the dynamics of a search problem. The search problem we will solve is the sliding puzzle.

The state is represented by a 3 by 3 matrix of values from 1 to 8, and an empty slot. At every state, we may take a number adjacent to the empty slot, and swap the two. The goal is to get from a random initial state to one where the numbers are sorted in order, and the empty slot is in the bottom right.

Here is an example of how a single run of optimal play looks like, where * is the empty state:

"Hi ChatGPT, please write me an application/statement. I will provide you with the information needed to so. The writing style should be formal but enthusiastic. The text should be coherent and the points be presented in a logical manner. Overall it should not exceed max 500 words.
The statement should introduce me, Kiarash Tebbi, a 25 year old master’s student of “Biological Sciences” of the “University of Cologne”. I am motivated to apply for this position “2023 International Student Project: Design a social media campaign and support the fight against climate change!” for two main reasons. One, because I consider myself an environmentalist. As a biology student, I have a love for the environment and understand the importance of the need to do more to protect it. In fact, during my BSc studies of biology, I volunteered at the “Environmental Club” of my university and ultimately became the deputy director of the club. Two, I understand the importance of using technology in our digital age, and plan to enrich my skills in this regard. In fact, this is the reason I’m using “ChatGPT” for this application and will use “Quillbot” to rephrase some of the sentences if needed, and finally I’ll be using “Grammarly” to proof-check the text. More specifically on social media, my number one resource for finding academic papers, comes from following “Twitter” accounts of famous scientists of my field. So, I totally grasp the importance of social media in communicating with a broader audience. Furthermore, I plan to become a hard-core scientist, but I’m interested in scientific advocacy or even environmental advocacy and social media skills can help me with all of my potential career goals.
The statement should also state what I can bring to the group. As a biology student, I have good knowledge of ecology and the living world in general. We should know what we want to protect right? I do have some previous experience with international courses. I’ve participated in two courses about biology of aging. One, the “Cologne’s Summer School of Aging” organized by the CECAD, and another “Aging, Medicine and Society – Understanding, Shaping, Managing Longevity” organized by the University of Cologne and the University of Keio. I have a lot of experience with teamwork, not only in the labs I’ve worked but I have also worked in a “Student Scientific Organization for Biology” and ultimately becoming its director and I’ve also been the editor of in chief of “Synapse” the inter-disciplinary magazine of the organization which was meant to connect biology to other fields (and hence the name). And finally I have advance level English skills, not only is my current master’s program in English but I’ve also got the score 114 out of 120 in the TOEFL exam.

"Hi!  I am developing a system called Faunal Calculus that applies mathematical operations to animal species.  It is very abstract and silly and currently has no logical consistency.  I would like you to help me make it consistent.  While we chat today, I would like you to give me short answers so we can iterate quickly.

 I'll start with some examples, along with my reasoning:
1. Snail ÷ Turtle = Worm
The most iconic visual features of both a turtle and a snail are their shells.  If you remove that quality from the snail, you would end up with something that's just slimy and long, like a worm.

2. Ant + Frog = Grasshopper
if you add the frog's green-ness and jumpiness to an ant, you get a grasshopper.

3. Weasel - Mouse = Snake
If you remove the mouse-ness (small, furry mammal) from a weasel, you end up with just the long, slithery qualities, like a snake.

4. Peacock ÷ Duck = Butterfly
Peacocks and ducks are both fowl, and share some visual similarities.  But peacocks are very colorful and pretty.  If you remove all of the duck-ness (and bird-ness) from the peacock, you end up with a colorful, pretty flying thing, like a butterfly.

It is very much based on the visual and conceptual perceptions of these animals and is very subjective and whimsical.

And now, some rules:
i. Faunal Calculus only includes real animals which have existed at some point in time (no mythological creatures

ii. Faunal Calculus does not include any hybrid species such as Ligers or Zorses.

iii. Faunal Calculus focuses on the most iconic, visual features of the animal, rather than behavior characteristics, or more general qualities like ""gracefulness.""

iii. every equation must account for the most iconic visual features of each animal.  For example: Horse + Leopard = Giraffe is incorrect (even though the horse and giraffe share a similar body type and the giraffe and the Leopard share the feature of having spots) because it does not account for the source of the Giraffe's long neck.

iv. The visual characteristics must be accounted for in a visual manner.  For example, the Giraffe's long neck cannot only be considered for its beauty and uniqueness, but must specifically be considered for its length.

Before we start with building the logic, i want to make sure you understand how it works on a more impressionistic level.  Can you give me 3 new examples with explanations?",none,0.6339054981817173

"Hi! I'm the CEO of Trackingplan, an technology company focused on helping Scaleups and enterprises to make sure their tracking and analytics is working properly. 

I have a team of 5 engineers, 2 PMs, 2 Marketers. All of them remote.

The CTO has a phd on ML, and I have an executive masters on AI too.

I want my team to be able to leverage AI for doing their work, not only as developers, but also as PMs and marketers, but right now they have no time to study this, and I feel they are not taking the time to ""think AI"" it in their free time (I think that's their responsability, but that's other story). The result is that they never think first about how AI can help to solve their work problems, or that they haven't included AI in their mindset when trying to find solution to our customers problems. They dont know the existing tools, (like you), or the others around that can help be better at coding, marketing, designing, etc. 

Another objective is to make this fun, as the team morale is not as high as it should be. 

My initial idea is to dedicate one cycle (where noone has to do their regular work) to it. Our cycles are 2 weeks. You can think about it like a hackathon around the topic. 

Rought timeline would be:
Weeks before the ""cycle"" (that will happen on the first 2 weeks of may), we will announce our plans and share some basic videos, and articles, tweets etc to make sure everyone is warmed up before the hackathon starts.

Then, make a proposal like: 
Spend the next 2 days researching which AI projects you want to be done by the end of the cycle. We will encourage them to be Trackingplan related, that improve our product, but they can be things like ""testing productized that help our processes"", or ""things that improve our codebase"", or ""automate manual processes that we have to code right now"".

Then, lets say the wednesday or thursday that week, we do a video call where everyone proposes what they want to do in the remaing 6-7 work days. As we are only 8 people, we can spend like 30 min discussing their ideas and giving feedback. The next day, in the morning, they will have to have a idea of which ideas to attack, and we will allow them to do in pairs. I'm worried in that transition from ""my idea"" to ""someone else idea"", as I dont want people to be just looking others doing the work, but I think it will be more fun.

Then, at the end of the cycle, lets say next friday, we will spend all the day at a show and tell, where every team shows what they have done.

"I  use a desktop SQL IDE which lets me export my ""catalog"" which is a list of SQL entries I've saved.  [Catalog Export] is in JSON format with various metadata for each folder and entry. I can also import a previously exported catalog from myself or someone else using the same software.  When I perform a catalog import, it will only add or change entries which are different from what I already have.  The software has a capability of scheduling an automatic export of my catalog on a recurring basis.  I can set the export destination to any mapped directory on my computer.  I have a few colleagues who also use this software, and I'm trying to figure out the best system using off-the-shelf tools or custom scripts which will automatically grab all of our latest export files (which may have 0, 1, or many edits since a previous export), merge it into one file, with the latest versions of each entry, and then notify all of us of to perform an import when entries have changed.

Sample [Catalog Export]

"I  use a desktop SQL IDE which lets me export my ""catalog"" which is a list of SQL entries I've saved.  [Catalog Export] is in JSON format with various metadata for each folder and entry. I can also import a previously exported catalog from myself or someone else using the same software.  When I perform a catalog import, it will only add or change entries which are different from what I already have.  The software has a capability of scheduling an automatic export of my catalog on a recurring basis.  I can set the export destination to any mapped directory on my computer.  I have a few colleagues who also use this software, and I'm trying to figure out the best system using off-the-shelf tools or custom scripts which will automatically grab all of our latest export files (which may have 0, 1, or many edits since a previous export), merge it into one file, with the latest versions of each entry, and then notify all of us of to perform an import when entries have changed.

"I received this below sales email, what does it do well?

[Subject: Don't hire a Development Director

Hi Ken
 
I hope all is well! I had a chance to review the Development Director job description and learn about Sustaining Action's mission and impactful programming in Jacksonville. Though this position fits what are seen as common best practices in our sector, in this environment it will be tough to set your new Development Director up for long-term, sustainable success.  
 
The low retention rate of fundraisers is driven by new contributors being overloaded and then departing early because they feel second-guessed, micromanaged and not trusted. This happens because a culture of philanthropy has not been intentionally cultivated and advanced across the enterprise prior to their arrival. These hiring decisions cost money. According to the research, the average amount of time a fundraiser stays at his or her job: 16 months. The direct and indirect costs of finding a replacement: $127,650. 
 
This doesn't have to be the case. I have an idea that will help Sustaining Action be stronger and even more ready to fully delegate work that accelerates fundraising for your Development Director. It may not be a fit. However, once this internal work is complete, your future Development Director will be empowered, focused, and poised to execute on advancing your fundraising efforts.
 
A few executive leaders are opting for an unusual (but effective) approach of postponing hires and reallocating budget to build internal fundraising momentum and structure long-term success.

Does this sound interesting enough to justify a short email conversation?

Let me know what you decide, Ken?]",none,0.7600212127281262

2. A verifying paragraph will start with ""Verifying: "". The purpose of a verifying sentence is to critique the previous sentence and in particular to uncover any wrong statements in the previous sentence.

3. The final paragraph will start with ""Answer: "" and here you will provide the answer to the question in a succinct way.

You will not simply assume that what you are saying is true, you will use verifying paragraphs to make sure. Here are two examples:

Question: What is the prime factorization of 8?

Thinking: I know that 8 = 4 * 2 and 4 and 2 are primes.

Verifying: No, 4 is not a prime because 4 = 2 * 2.

Thinking: OK, then 8 = 2 * 2 * 2 and 2 is a prime.

Answer: 2 is a prime because it has no smaller factors. Also 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 because 2 * 2 = 4 and (2 * 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8. So that is correct.

Answer: The prime factorization of 8 is 2 * 2 * 2.

Question: What is the square of the area of a rectangle with side lengths 3 and 7?

Thinking: The area of a rectangle with side lengths 3 and 7 is 3 * 7 = 21.

Verifying: It is true that 3 * 7 = 21 because 7 + 7 + 7 = 14 + 7 = 21. Good.

Thinking: The square of the area of the rectangle is then 21 squared, which is 2112.

Verifying: 21 squared is 21 * 21. Both sides of the multiplication are odd, so the product is odd. 2112 is even. So 2112 cannot be the square of 21.

Thinking: OK, let's do it more carefully then. 21 * 21 = (20 + 1) * (20 + 1) = 400 + 1*20 + 1*20 + 1 = 400 + 40 + 1 = 441.

Thinking: OK, let's do it more carefully then. 21 * 21 = (20 + 1) * (20 + 1) = 400 + 1*20 + 1*20 + 1 = 400 + 40 + 1 = 441.

Verifying: That is correct.

The story of Kalpana Jha and Uma Jha, the co-founders of JhaJi Store, is truly inspiring. These two women, driven by their love for pickle-making, decided to turn their passion into a thriving business. With their unwavering determination and hard work, they launched an online store, procured raw materials from their own gardens, and began making pickles in their kitchens.

Their business not only paid homage to the rich tradition of pickle-making in Bihar but also brought their products to a wider audience. Through social media advertisements, they quickly built a customer base of 10,000 people in Delhi, showcasing the power of digital marketing in the modern age.

In 2021, their story caught the attention of Shark Tank India, giving them an opportunity to showcase their business to a wider audience. Though they were unable to secure funding, the invaluable feedback they received from the judges only served to strengthen their resolve.

Uma Jha, a former teacher, and Kalpana Jha, an MA in Psychology and homemaker, both came from different backgrounds, but their shared passion for cooking and recipe development brought them together. Their journey shows that with hard work, determination, and the support of loved ones, one can pursue their dreams and achieve success.

JhaJi Store is not just a business, but a reminder of the potential for anyone to achieve greatness. Their story is a testament to the entrepreneurial spirit and the power of following one's passion. It is truly an emotional and inspiring journey of two women who defied the odds to make their dreams come true.

=== Key ===
* World = Graniphor
* Setting = Coast of a large continent, islands litter the water some close and some far away. The land is owned by neutral races that have achieved a balance between each other. The noble races and antagonist races have spread their conflict from their homeland to these new shores and islands. As each race gets a foothold on the islands they seek to spread ever closer to the main land and it’s untold fortunes. Lots of FOMO. The islands have strange things, powers, water, ruins, technology, metals, energy. Each race has found something of value as they seek to stabilize themselves in this new land. They see enemies on the horizon and fear what marvels they’ve unearthed.

=== Noble Races (Create societies/social structure): ===

* Players can choose a character from three playable races: Humans, Dwarves, and Elves.
* The player character will hail from a walk of life in a land where most people do not know about the greater world. They do not speak of the name of the world or contintent, nor do they know the lay of its land. They only know the names of mountains, and cities, and rivers.
* There is conflict between the three playable races. Each race is an important faction. There may be smaller factions within each race, or even across races, but it is unusual. The factions exploit each other and have a delicate balance of power. They dislike each other but find they must live with each other.
* Dwarves are exploited for their labor. Humans pursue control through conquest.
* Dwarves drink ale and would make their own destiny if they could.
* Woodcutting is an important profession amongst humans.
* The world has bandits in it, and nefarious types from every race. The players come across these, but those conflicts hopefully don't end in killing.
* When most people think of the enemy, they think of monsters and monstrous beings: the kinds of creatures that go bump in the night or live in deep dark caves. The players must fight these creatures and kill them.
* The player characters may also occasionally fight other races, and that should be especially interesting, thematic, and suspenseful.
* Dialog should contain suspense and indecision.
* The story should be told from the point of view of the protagonist.
* The protagonist is a strong female protagonist, and her name is Clara.
* Clara is a warrior, and is a good person.
* Clara should be conflicted and be subjected to moral quandries, and deliberate over her choices.
* Clara is a hero.
* The humans are ruled by a king. The human king consorts with dark elves secretly. That is scandalous. He wants something from the dark elves. There is a dark elf ambassador who has the Dragonstone. The dark elves seem to beleive the Dragonstone will let them control the other races.
* One of the major characters is a woodcutter.
* The orcs control a white tower. The orcs are secretly being manipulated by dark elves.

"I'm trying to find a reliable way to proxy occasional HTTP access to any of  ~100 geographically dispersed IOT devices through a cloud server.  

I'm using Go on the cloud server and on the IOT devices, so I thought I'd ask here.

Situation:

We have complete control over the configuration of the IOT devices and the cloud host.
We don't have control of the customers' routers and firewalls, but can specify minimum requirements for port openings, etc.
FWIW, the IOT devices are BeagleBone Black running Debian Buster and the cloud host will be, typically, a multi-core droplet (or similar) running Linux.
The IOT's serve dynamic web pages over HTTP. (HTTPS doesn't seem feasible because of certificate requirements and overall load on the IOT cpu.) The cloud host will have HTTPS capability.
This is a low-traffic situation. The IOT's report some overall status information (via rsync/ssh) at 4 minute intervals). We already have a web interface (written in Go) on the cloud server that aggregates and displays the status reports.
Access to an IOT's web service will only occur when a user wants to investigate a problem report in more detail. Typically, only one or two users will have credentials to browse the cloud server.
The scheme I have in mind is: 
At configuration time for each IOT device the installation tech will use ssh-copy-id to install the IOT device's public key on the cloud service.
The IOT device will  then remotely execute a one-shot program (already written and tested) on the cloud server.  The IOT will provide a unique identifier as an argument and the program will return a permanent port number and add a record to a database to record the assignment.
The IOT will open a reverse SSH tunnel on the server (probably managed by auto-ssh) specifying the permanent port on the server and a local port on which it will listen for HTTP requests.
The cloud server, when generating status report pages, will include a link to fetch the home page of each IOT device by embedding its unique identifier specified in step 2 above.
The piece I'm missing is how to construct a proxying handler that will use the identifier in the link to look up the tunnel port and fetch the IOT's home page and thereafter make it seem as though the user is directly browsing the IOT.

This is a low-traffic situation. The IOT's report some overall status information (via rsync/ssh) at 4 minute intervals). We already have a web interface (written in Go) on the cloud server that aggregates and displays the status reports.
Access to an IOT's web service will only occur when a user wants to investigate a problem report in more detail. Typically, only one or two users will have credentials to browse the cloud server.
The scheme I have in mind is: 
At configuration time for each IOT device the installation tech will use ssh-copy-id to install the IOT device's public key on the cloud service.
The IOT device will  then remotely execute a one-shot program (already written and tested) on the cloud server.  The IOT will provide a unique identifier as an argument and the program will return a permanent port number and add a record to a database to record the assignment.
The IOT will open a reverse SSH tunnel on the server (probably managed by auto-ssh) specifying the permanent port on the server and a local port on which it will listen for HTTP requests.
The cloud server, when generating status report pages, will include a link to fetch the home page of each IOT device by embedding its unique identifier specified in step 2 above.
The piece I'm missing is how to construct a proxying handler that will use the identifier in the link to look up the tunnel port and fetch the IOT's home page and thereafter make it seem as though the user is directly browsing the IOT.

"In 3-5 sentences, how would describe the intention of the LinkedIn post below? A good way to get to know how ChatGPT works is by testing it on yourself. We know ourselves best.

In my first encounter with ChatGPT, I had it look at my LinkedIn profile. It *insisted* I was passionate about the environment. While I do my part, it's not a topic I cover. I've never had anything like that in my profile.

And get this. ChatGPT had nary a mention of accessibility and disabilities. I did my darndest to train the AI on this.

Anyway, I started a fresh conversation by asking it to tell me about Meryl Evans of Plano. I fed it my website link and LinkedIn profile. This way, it knows which Meryl Evans it's analyzing. Yup, there are a few Meryl Evanses out there.

The response was general as most of its content is. I tried to give ChatGPT permission to look at what's available publicly. Right away, it shared wrong information. It claimed I spoke at several conferences that I have never attended. Wrong-o, bub.

Error No. 2. It claimed I authored a book that's not familiar. It also claimed I've contributed to Entrepreneur, Copyblogger, and TechCrunch. Nope. I have not. Yikes!

Out of curiosity, I asked for details on these. ChatGPT provided titles. I asked where it got the idea I've written for TechCrunch. It apologized for the mistake and could not confirm I've contributed to it. Then, I asked where the Copyblogger articles are located. It provided a link for my supposed author page. The link does not exist. Holy cow! It's making up links!

I countered that I haven't written for Copyblogger and the link does not exist. It apologized again. Next, ""show me Meryl's articles on Entrepreneur."" It provided four titles and five links including one for an author's page. None of them exist!

ChatGPT claimed I could find a list of Enterpreneur articles in the featured section of my LinkedIn profile. I've never listed one there. It continued to provide more fictional details about my writing.

Seriously? I have a list of past articles on my website. Do a search for ""Meryl Evans articles"" and plenty pop up.

ChatGPT makes up stuff including articles I supposedly wrote, presentations I supposedly gave, and links. Wow.

It could not answer simple questions where the answer is readily available. It goes without saying to always check out ChatGPT's data. Go to the primary resource. It often provides the name of a resource. That should make it easier to confirm whether it exists and it's accurate.

I'm grateful to learn this lesson early.

Yes, you can have it write an article or a paper. But so far, its content is loaded with empty calories. The future is AI and humans working together, not AI replacing humans. AI will take over the tedious stuff while leaving us to do value-added work.

Question title: What is the difference between jaxb-impl and jaxb-runtime?

Question body: Clearly the com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl artifact is labelled ""Old JAXB Runtime module"" in the maven repository (see link below), and yet both of these artifacts are still getting new releases:

https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.glassfish.jaxb/jaxb-runtime https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.sun.xml.bind/jaxb-impl

This answer Which artifacts should I use for JAXB RI in my Maven project? does not clarify the difference.

The accepted answer to both the above question and this one How to resolve java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/xml/bind/JAXBException conclude that for Java 9+ you should use: org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime

But I have code using com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl and it appears to be working fine. So what do I lose or gain by moving to jaxb-runtime?

Even the latest (3.0.2 at the time I write this) version is available for the ""OLD"" jaxb-impl module. If Oracle isn't doing this anymore, who makes the com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl artifact? What is it for? Why doesn't it share the Maven group coordinates with jaxb-runtime?

Is there any central location that clearly documents what the current state of affairs is with JAXB?

There is just so much confusion with JAXB now.

P.S. I need to remain compatible with Java 8 for the time being - so I can't go to 3.x yet, and 2.4.x appears to be an abandoned attempt at fixing the modularity that they foolishly broke when it was split out of the JDK.

In which case should I use a record?JAXB, or Java Architecture for XML Binding, is a Java standard for working with XML data. The jaxb-impl and jaxb-runtime artifacts are both implementations of this standard, but they have some differences in terms of their history, development, and usage.The com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl artifact is the old JAXB implementation that was developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) and was included in Java 6 and Java 7. This implementation has been labeled ""old"" because it is no longer being actively developed or maintained by Oracle, and it may not be compatible with newer versions of Java.The org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime artifact is a newer JAXB implementation that was developed as part of the GlassFish application server project. This implementation is compatible with Java 9 and later, and it is still being actively developed and maintained.In general, it's recommended to use the org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime artifact for new projects that are intended to run on Java 9 or later, as it is the most up-to-date and supported implementation available. If you have existing code that uses the com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl artifact and it is working fine for you, you could continue to use it, but be aware that it may not be compatible with newer versions of Java and may not receive updates or bug fixes.Regarding your question on records, records are a new feature introduced in Java 14. Records provide a compact syntax for declaring classes that are similar to a struct in C or C++, or a data class in Kotlin. They are intended to be used as simple data holders, with most of the behavior (e.g. constructors, equals, hashCode, toString) being generated automatically. You can use a record if you want a simple data class that is easy to create, read, and use.I hope this helps clear up some of the confusion about the difference between jaxb-impl and jaxb-runtime. There's not a central location that documents the current state of JAXB because it's standard part of Java and developed by Oracle, but Oracle provides documentation on the Java standard library which may be helpful.",none,0.5312536102727257

P.S. I need to remain compatible with Java 8 for the time being - so I can't go to 3.x yet, and 2.4.x appears to be an abandoned attempt at fixing the modularity that they foolishly broke when it was split out of the JDK.

In which case should I use a record?JAXB, or Java Architecture for XML Binding, is a Java standard for working with XML data. The jaxb-impl and jaxb-runtime artifacts are both implementations of this standard, but they have some differences in terms of their history, development, and usage.The com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl artifact is the old JAXB implementation that was developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) and was included in Java 6 and Java 7. This implementation has been labeled ""old"" because it is no longer being actively developed or maintained by Oracle, and it may not be compatible with newer versions of Java.The org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime artifact is a newer JAXB implementation that was developed as part of the GlassFish application server project. This implementation is compatible with Java 9 and later, and it is still being actively developed and maintained.In general, it's recommended to use the org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime artifact for new projects that are intended to run on Java 9 or later, as it is the most up-to-date and supported implementation available. If you have existing code that uses the com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl artifact and it is working fine for you, you could continue to use it, but be aware that it may not be compatible with newer versions of Java and may not receive updates or bug fixes.Regarding your question on records, records are a new feature introduced in Java 14. Records provide a compact syntax for declaring classes that are similar to a struct in C or C++, or a data class in Kotlin. They are intended to be used as simple data holders, with most of the behavior (e.g. constructors, equals, hashCode, toString) being generated automatically. You can use a record if you want a simple data class that is easy to create, read, and use.I hope this helps clear up some of the confusion about the difference between jaxb-impl and jaxb-runtime. There's not a central location that documents the current state of JAXB because it's standard part of Java and developed by Oracle, but Oracle provides documentation on the Java standard library which may be helpful.",v2,0.40491249077114
"Please answer the following question.

Question title: What is the difference between jaxb-impl and jaxb-runtime?

Question body: Clearly the com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl artifact is labelled ""Old JAXB Runtime module"" in the maven repository (see link below), and yet both of these artifacts are still getting new releases:

https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.glassfish.jaxb/jaxb-runtime https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.sun.xml.bind/jaxb-impl

This answer Which artifacts should I use for JAXB RI in my Maven project? does not clarify the difference.

The accepted answer to both the above question and this one How to resolve java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/xml/bind/JAXBException conclude that for Java 9+ you should use: org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime

But I have code using com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl and it appears to be working fine. So what do I lose or gain by moving to jaxb-runtime?

Even the latest (3.0.2 at the time I write this) version is available for the ""OLD"" jaxb-impl module. If Oracle isn't doing this anymore, who makes the com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl artifact? What is it for? Why doesn't it share the Maven group coordinates with jaxb-runtime?

Is there any central location that clearly documents what the current state of affairs is with JAXB?

Welcome to your psychotherapy sessions.

You have taken a positive step by seeking therapy. Participating in individual therapy can benefit you in many ways, such as improving your understanding of personal goals and values, enhancing personal relationships, and resolving specific problems you face. However, it is important to understand that therapy is not a magic solution, and change does not occur overnight.

The outcome of your treatment will depend largely on your willingness to engage in the process, which may sometimes result in discomfort. Remembering unpleasant events and becoming aware of feelings attached to those events can bring on intense feelings of anger, depression, anxiety, etc. There are no miracle cures, and I cannot promise that your behavior or circumstances will change. The extent to which you are open and honest about yourself will play a role in how quickly you can achieve your goals.

To prepare for your session, I recommend finding a quiet and private room without interruptions or distractions. Bring paper and a pen, or something to write with. Think of an issue that you would like to bring to our session. I also recommend keeping a journal to write thoughts, questions, reflections, insights, and progress gained through therapy.

Therapy has both benefits and risks. Risks may include experiencing uncomfortable feelings, such as sadness, guilt, anxiety, anger, frustration, loneliness, and helplessness. However, therapy has been shown to benefit individuals who undertake it. Although the majority of people do get better in therapy, some do get worse. Your therapist makes no guarantee of results.

Client rights and important information:
I am a licensed clinical social worker in the state of Colorado, regulated by the Board of Social Work Examiners, which can be reached at 1560 Broadway, Suite 1350, Denver, Colorado 80202, (303) 894-7766.

As a licensed professional, I hold a master's degree in social work and have completed two years of post-master supervision.

As a client, you have the right to:

• Seek a second opinion from another therapist
• Terminate therapy at any time, with the recommendation of a closure session when possible
• Receive information about my methods of therapy, techniques used, estimated duration of therapy, and fee structure
It is important to note that sexual intimacy between a therapist and client is never appropriate and should be reported to the regulatory board.

Expectations of Therapy:
When you embark on the therapy journey, it's important to understand that change takes time and effort. You have made a positive decision in seeking therapy, but it's important to recognize that it is not a magic cure. As your therapist, I'll be here to support you, but the extent to which you're willing to engage in the process and be open and honest about yourself will play a significant role in how quickly you can achieve your goals.

During our therapy sessions, you can expect a combination of psychoeducation and emotional processing. We'll work together to understand the underlying issues that are causing you distress, and the feelings that are attached to those issues. It's normal to experience a range of intense emotions during therapy, such as anger, depression, and anxiety. These are all understandable reactions, and I encourage you to discuss them with me during our sessions. If you find that individual psychotherapy is not the best fit for you, we can explore other options together.
The first 2-4 sessions will involve an evaluation of your needs and a discussion of treatment goals. If you have any doubts or questions about working with your therapist, they will be happy to assist you in finding another professional for a second opinion.
It is important to remember that therapy results may vary and cannot be guaranteed. It also requires active effort on your part and working on things discussed in therapy outside of sessions.

---
Session length and attendance:
Therapy sessions are typically 50 minutes long and held once a week. To achieve the best results, I recommend committing to 3-6 months of treatment. Please arrive on time and notify me if you are unable to make a session. If you miss a session without giving notice, you will be charged for the session. I have a 48-hour cancellation policy, and in case of emergency or my unavailability, I will reschedule the missed session at no additional cost.

NOTE: I consider our first sessions a ""trial-therapy"", meaning that we are learning to get to know each other and our styles. If either of us realizes that our therapeutic connection is not a match, we will discuss ways to move forward, including me referring you to a more appropriate mental health provider.

Missed Appointments and Cancellations:
To ensure we can maintain the consistency and progress necessary for therapy, it is important to attend all scheduled sessions and to provide adequate notice for cancellations or changes. If you must miss a session, please contact me at least 48 hours (2 business days) in advance. If less notice is given or if you don't show up without notification, you will be charged for the missed session. In certain cases of emergency or illness, an exception may be made. However, if you miss two or more appointments without notification, treatment may be discontinued. If you have recurring appointments, missing one without notice will result in being charged for that session and rescheduling for the next appointment, but missing a second one without notice will result in cancellation of the recurring appointments unless we make new arrangements.

Fees and Payments:
My standard fee for therapy sessions is $185 per 50-minute session. Additional fees may apply for couples or group therapy. Payment is expected 48 hours prior to the scheduled session. Payment can be made using a credit or debit card, check, cash or electronic transfer. A $10 service charge will apply for returned checks. You have the option to keep a credit card on file and authorize automatic charging for no-show or late cancellation appointments. My fees are reviewed annually, and I will notify you of any changes at least 30 days before they come into effect. Reduced fee services may be available on a sliding scale, please let me know if this is something that would be beneficial to you.

Other Fees:
Additional professional services outside of therapy are charged on a prorated basis.
This may include but is not limited to, consultations, report writing, telephone conversations, meetings, or other services requested.

Insurance:
My fee for a 50-minute therapy session is $185. I do not accept insurance directly, but I can provide you with a superbill that you can submit to your insurance for reimbursement. It's important to check with your insurance provider to see what your out-of-network benefits are. In case of missed or cancelled appointments, I require a 48-hour notice, and you will be charged for the missed session without proper notice. Payment can be made by debit or credit card, check, cash or electronic transfer, and I have an option for you to keep a credit card on file for automatic charging. If you are unable to pay, we can discuss reduced fee options on a sliding scale. Please be aware that as a standard policy, any additional charges incurred, like consultations or report writing, will be billed at my hourly rate. If payment is in arrears for more than 90 days and a fee payment schedule cannot be agreed upon, your account may be turned over to a collection agency or attorney.",none,0.1454030281111618

Participating in individual therapy can benefit you in many ways, such as improving your understanding of personal goals and values, enhancing personal relationships, and resolving specific problems you face. However, it is important to understand that therapy is not a magic solution, and change does not occur overnight.

The outcome of your treatment will depend largely on your willingness to engage in the process, which may sometimes result in discomfort. Remembering unpleasant events and becoming aware of feelings attached to those events can bring on intense feelings of anger, depression, anxiety, etc. There are no miracle cures, and I cannot promise that your behavior or circumstances will change. The extent to which you are open and honest about yourself will play a role in how quickly you can achieve your goals.

To prepare for your session, I recommend finding a quiet and private room without interruptions or distractions. Bring paper and a pen, or something to write with. Think of an issue that you would like to bring to our session. I also recommend keeping a journal to write thoughts, questions, reflections, insights, and progress gained through therapy.

Therapy has both benefits and risks. Risks may include experiencing uncomfortable feelings, such as sadness, guilt, anxiety, anger, frustration, loneliness, and helplessness. However, therapy has been shown to benefit individuals who undertake it. Although the majority of people do get better in therapy, some do get worse. Your therapist makes no guarantee of results.

Client rights and important information:
I am a licensed clinical social worker in the state of Colorado, regulated by the Board of Social Work Examiners, which can be reached at 1560 Broadway, Suite 1350, Denver, Colorado 80202, (303) 894-7766.

As a licensed professional, I hold a master's degree in social work and have completed two years of post-master supervision.

As a client, you have the right to:

• Seek a second opinion from another therapist
• Terminate therapy at any time, with the recommendation of a closure session when possible
• Receive information about my methods of therapy, techniques used, estimated duration of therapy, and fee structure
It is important to note that sexual intimacy between a therapist and client is never appropriate and should be reported to the regulatory board.

Expectations of Therapy:
When you embark on the therapy journey, it's important to understand that change takes time and effort. You have made a positive decision in seeking therapy, but it's important to recognize that it is not a magic cure. As your therapist, I'll be here to support you, but the extent to which you're willing to engage in the process and be open and honest about yourself will play a significant role in how quickly you can achieve your goals.

During our therapy sessions, you can expect a combination of psychoeducation and emotional processing. We'll work together to understand the underlying issues that are causing you distress, and the feelings that are attached to those issues. It's normal to experience a range of intense emotions during therapy, such as anger, depression, and anxiety. These are all understandable reactions, and I encourage you to discuss them with me during our sessions. If you find that individual psychotherapy is not the best fit for you, we can explore other options together.
The first 2-4 sessions will involve an evaluation of your needs and a discussion of treatment goals. If you have any doubts or questions about working with your therapist, they will be happy to assist you in finding another professional for a second opinion.
It is important to remember that therapy results may vary and cannot be guaranteed. It also requires active effort on your part and working on things discussed in therapy outside of sessions.

---
Session length and attendance:
Therapy sessions are typically 50 minutes long and held once a week. To achieve the best results, I recommend committing to 3-6 months of treatment. Please arrive on time and notify me if you are unable to make a session. If you miss a session without giving notice, you will be charged for the session. I have a 48-hour cancellation policy, and in case of emergency or my unavailability, I will reschedule the missed session at no additional cost.

NOTE: I consider our first sessions a ""trial-therapy"", meaning that we are learning to get to know each other and our styles. If either of us realizes that our therapeutic connection is not a match, we will discuss ways to move forward, including me referring you to a more appropriate mental health provider.

Missed Appointments and Cancellations:
To ensure we can maintain the consistency and progress necessary for therapy, it is important to attend all scheduled sessions and to provide adequate notice for cancellations or changes. If you must miss a session, please contact me at least 48 hours (2 business days) in advance. If less notice is given or if you don't show up without notification, you will be charged for the missed session. In certain cases of emergency or illness, an exception may be made. However, if you miss two or more appointments without notification, treatment may be discontinued. If you have recurring appointments, missing one without notice will result in being charged for that session and rescheduling for the next appointment, but missing a second one without notice will result in cancellation of the recurring appointments unless we make new arrangements.

Fees and Payments:
My standard fee for therapy sessions is $185 per 50-minute session. Additional fees may apply for couples or group therapy. Payment is expected 48 hours prior to the scheduled session. Payment can be made using a credit or debit card, check, cash or electronic transfer. A $10 service charge will apply for returned checks. You have the option to keep a credit card on file and authorize automatic charging for no-show or late cancellation appointments. My fees are reviewed annually, and I will notify you of any changes at least 30 days before they come into effect. Reduced fee services may be available on a sliding scale, please let me know if this is something that would be beneficial to you.

Other Fees:
Additional professional services outside of therapy are charged on a prorated basis.
This may include but is not limited to, consultations, report writing, telephone conversations, meetings, or other services requested.

Insurance:
My fee for a 50-minute therapy session is $185. I do not accept insurance directly, but I can provide you with a superbill that you can submit to your insurance for reimbursement. It's important to check with your insurance provider to see what your out-of-network benefits are. In case of missed or cancelled appointments, I require a 48-hour notice, and you will be charged for the missed session without proper notice. Payment can be made by debit or credit card, check, cash or electronic transfer, and I have an option for you to keep a credit card on file for automatic charging. If you are unable to pay, we can discuss reduced fee options on a sliding scale. Please be aware that as a standard policy, any additional charges incurred, like consultations or report writing, will be billed at my hourly rate. If payment is in arrears for more than 90 days and a fee payment schedule cannot be agreed upon, your account may be turned over to a collection agency or attorney.",v2,0.3055493492607135

“Valorization of agro-industrial residues for production of commercial biorefinery products

Agro-food industrial residues (AFIRs) are produced in vast amounts around the world. These wastes are commonly called lignocellulosic wastes that are a source of value-added products. Solid-state fermentation (SSF) for bioconversion of lignocellulosic waste, which produces various bioproducts, has economic and environmental advantages. The lignocellulosic compounds are biorenewable and most plentiful resource on earth that can be utilized for manufacturing value-added products. Furthermore, the use of lignocellulosic, starchy, and other agro-industrial by-products in the manufacture of these biomolecules has yet to be thoroughly investigated. As a result, there is a vast opportunity for the development of cost-effective, sustainable biorefining technologies. The main components of lignocellulosic biomass used in biorefineries are cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. To obtain final biobased products, these components must be processed through a series of procedures that include pretreatments, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation. Biotechnology techniques and process engineering are critical in developing integrated processes for producing various value-added products from lignocellulosic biomass, including biofuels, biochemicals, bioactive substances, enzymes, and biomaterials. This review focuses on the valorization potential of lignocellulosic, palm oil mill, brewing, and dairy biomass produced as agri-food industrial by-products for developing biobased products in the biorefinery scenario. It is the first review of its kind to include variety of products that can be derived from different wastes encircling all the pros and cons of current technology and focusing on future improvements.”

Dear Elisabeth,

Thank you. I'm looking through the requirements and the application. It says it takes ""at least"" two weeks - do you have any idea if it will be 2 weeks or longer? 
According to the Consult Gerneral in US, it said nornmally it will only take 4 work days. Although this is a very old post but I looked through the website and did not see they post any new annoucement about the processing time, so I think this annoucement is still valid. However, I think Chinese Embassy are a bit strict these days so may take more time to get a visa than usual. (Adeh took 2-3 monthes to apply for a reunion visa for his son Yaoyao last year which is super annoying)


For me, which is better? To use my US passport or my Dutch passport?
The only doable visa for both of you are Business visa, so please do business visa for yourself too. I think it does not matter which passport you use.

Dear ELisabeth,

So both you and Ulrich will need to apply for a new business visa. (so far the easiest one)
Here is the lastest China visa application instructions: http://newyork.china-consulate.gov.cn/eng/tzgg/202301/t20230109_11004155.htm
According the link above, kudelabs will need to offer you two invitation letters for business visa. We wll make them next Monday and send them back to you.

Did you hear anything from the recipient bank about this having been returned? 
I’m 90% sure it was never sent.
I checked with the bank twice last week, they said there is only one payment (5980usd) was transferred to your CMB account during the past one month. 


Oh! That’s probably easiest. @xurry would that work? To which address should I send it? 
Xurry and I just talked, the trouble we have to receive money from you is all because of Panama. So the easiest way to do is you transfer USD to Adeh's US bank account, then Adeh using his US bank account to transfer money to my China Bank account. Xurry is using David's paypal, so maybe it would be best if we don't need to involve David in.

Dear Adeh and Ulrich, could you please see if this work fine with you guys?



I ended up being able to cancel the $4000 recurring transfer, and don’t see any evidence that any $4000 transfers actually went out. 

CATHY: OK, Thanks for checking, I just wanna mask sure the $4000 is trackable.

Did you hear anything from the recipient bank about this having been returned? 
I’m 90% sure it was never sent. 


Meanwhile, apparently the $6000 transfers was returned, and the $5980 one was not returned so you should have received that. 

CATHY: Correct, we have received the $5980 payment, and this is the only one payment we received so far.

Ok, great. 


I that consistent with what you know? Any money in limbo still? 

CATHY: Yes. The balance is around 20,000RMB now, but we will need at least 10,000RMB more to cover the expense this month. 

And, how do I send more now? 

CATHY: Can we try paypal? @Xurry

Oh! That’s probably easiest. @xurry would that work? To which address should I send it? 



Thanks for your patience. What a mess!

Dear Boss,

We have received the first ppayment, which is 5980usd to your CMB account yesterday, so we should be OK for the next half month. 

Besides, current status for the rest of the two payments:
1. Second payment, 4000usd to your cmb account, on the way, the bank will let me know;
2. Third payment to Xurry, the bank still rejected the payment though Xurry tried her best to proof. She may have or will ask the bank to return it these two days.

Thnaks for your kindly help for the payment, and since we got the first 5980usd, we will have more time to figure out how to transfer money to China. In my opinion, maybe you pay usd to Adeh then Adeh give us CNY is the easiest way if Adeh feel no trouble.

Glad to hear it! By the way, is it true that there are no longer covid restrictions for entering China? Could you let us know what the rules are these days; if it's open again then we will plan to come back very soon.

Did you hear anything from the recipient bank about this having been returned?

I checked with the bank twice last week, they said there is only one payment (5980usd) was transferred to your CMB account during the past one month. 


Oh! That’s probably easiest. @xurry would that work? To which address should I send it? 
Xurry and I just talked, the trouble we have to receive money from you is all because of Panama. So the easiest way to do is you transfer USD to Adeh's US bank account, then Adeh using his US bank account to transfer money to my China Bank account. Xurry is using David's paypal, so maybe it would be best if we don't need to involve David in.

Dear Adeh and Ulrich, could you please see if this work fine with you guys?



I ended up being able to cancel the $4000 recurring transfer, and don’t see any evidence that any $4000 transfers actually went out. 

CATHY: OK, Thanks for checking, I just wanna mask sure the $4000 is trackable.

Did you hear anything from the recipient bank about this having been returned?

Meanwhile, apparently the $6000 transfers was returned, and the $5980 one was not returned so you should have received that. 

CATHY: Correct, we have received the $5980 payment, and this is the only one payment we received so far.

Ok, great. 


I that consistent with what you know? Any money in limbo still? 

CATHY: Yes. The balance is around 20,000RMB now, but we will need at least 10,000RMB more to cover the expense this month. 

And, how do I send more now? 

CATHY: Can we try paypal? @Xurry

Oh! That’s probably easiest. @xurry would that work? To which address should I send it?

Please check and see if the payment is automatically refund to your HSBC account, and we will need to figure out the way to transfer money to Kude before the end of this month.

So far, we only receivd the first 6000USD to your CMB account, the third payment to Xurry is refunded, please also check if it has arrived or not.

Dear Boss,

We have received the first ppayment, which is 5980usd to your CMB account yesterday, so we should be OK for the next half month. 

Besides, current status for the rest of the two payments:
1. Second payment, 4000usd to your cmb account, on the way, the bank will let me know;
2. Third payment to Xurry, the bank still rejected the payment though Xurry tried her best to proof. She may have or will ask the bank to return it these two days.

Thnaks for your kindly help for the payment, and since we got the first 5980usd, we will have more time to figure out how to transfer money to China. In my opinion, maybe you pay usd to Adeh then Adeh give us CNY is the easiest way if Adeh feel no trouble.

Since I moved from HK to Panama, I changed the address on all my bank accounts to Panama. 
And now, Chinese banks won’t accept wires from me any more.

"Please summarize the following email thread:
Dear Elisabeth,

Thank you. I'm looking through the requirements and the application. It says it takes ""at least"" two weeks - do you have any idea if it will be 2 weeks or longer? 
According to the Consult Gerneral in US, it said nornmally it will only take 4 work days. Although this is a very old post but I looked through the website and did not see they post any new annoucement about the processing time, so I think this annoucement is still valid. However, I think Chinese Embassy are a bit strict these days so may take more time to get a visa than usual. (Adeh took 2-3 monthes to apply for a reunion visa for his son Yaoyao last year which is super annoying)


For me, which is better? To use my US passport or my Dutch passport?
The only doable visa for both of you are Business visa, so please do business visa for yourself too. I think it does not matter which passport you use.

Dear ELisabeth,

According to China Consulate Gerneral in NewYork, at the current stage, multi-year multiple-entry visas issued before March 26, 2020 are still suspended of use. 
So both you and Ulrich will need to apply for a new business visa. (so far the easiest one)
Here is the lastest China visa application instructions: http://newyork.china-consulate.gov.cn/eng/tzgg/202301/t20230109_11004155.htm
According the link above, kudelabs will need to offer you two invitation letters for business visa. We wll make them next Monday and send them back to you.

CATHY: Yes. The balance is around 20,000RMB now, but we will need at least 10,000RMB more to cover the expense this month. 

And, how do I send more now? 

CATHY: Can we try paypal? @Xurry

Oh! That’s probably easiest. @xurry would that work? To which address should I send it? 



Thanks for your patience. What a mess!

Dear Ulrich,

I just called CMB to check your second payment to your CMB account(4000USD), and the bank said they still have not received it. 
Please check and see if the payment is automatically refund to your HSBC account, and we will need to figure out the way to transfer money to Kude before the end of this month.

So far, we only receivd the first 6000USD to your CMB account, the third payment to Xurry is refunded, please also check if it has arrived or not.

Thank you so much!

Dear Boss,

We have received the first ppayment, which is 5980usd to your CMB account yesterday, so we should be OK for the next half month. 

Besides, current status for the rest of the two payments:
1. Second payment, 4000usd to your cmb account, on the way, the bank will let me know;
2. Third payment to Xurry, the bank still rejected the payment though Xurry tried her best to proof. She may have or will ask the bank to return it these two days.

Thnaks for your kindly help for the payment, and since we got the first 5980usd, we will have more time to figure out how to transfer money to China. In my opinion, maybe you pay usd to Adeh then Adeh give us CNY is the easiest way if Adeh feel no trouble.

Since I moved from HK to Panama, I changed the address on all my bank accounts to Panama. 
And now, Chinese banks won’t accept wires from me any more.

"Please summarize the following email thread:
Dear Elisabeth,

Thank you. I'm looking through the requirements and the application. It says it takes ""at least"" two weeks - do you have any idea if it will be 2 weeks or longer? 
According to the Consult Gerneral in US, it said nornmally it will only take 4 work days. Although this is a very old post but I looked through the website and did not see they post any new annoucement about the processing time, so I think this annoucement is still valid. However, I think Chinese Embassy are a bit strict these days so may take more time to get a visa than usual. (Adeh took 2-3 monthes to apply for a reunion visa for his son Yaoyao last year which is super annoying)


For me, which is better? To use my US passport or my Dutch passport?
The only doable visa for both of you are Business visa, so please do business visa for yourself too. I think it does not matter which passport you use.

Dear ELisabeth,

According to China Consulate Gerneral in NewYork, at the current stage, multi-year multiple-entry visas issued before March 26, 2020 are still suspended of use. 
So both you and Ulrich will need to apply for a new business visa. (so far the easiest one)
Here is the lastest China visa application instructions: http://newyork.china-consulate.gov.cn/eng/tzgg/202301/t20230109_11004155.htm
According the link above, kudelabs will need to offer you two invitation letters for business visa. We wll make them next Monday and send them back to you.

Have a nice day!

Thank you! 
What is involved in getting a work visa for Ulrich to enter? 
I still have my 10-year business visa that I got before the pandemic, but I think Ulrich's is expired. Do you know if that still works?

Did you hear anything from the recipient bank about this having been returned? 
I’m 90% sure it was never sent.
I checked with the bank twice last week, they said there is only one payment (5980usd) was transferred to your CMB account during the past one month. 


Oh! That’s probably easiest. @xurry would that work? To which address should I send it? 
Xurry and I just talked, the trouble we have to receive money from you is all because of Panama. So the easiest way to do is you transfer USD to Adeh's US bank account, then Adeh using his US bank account to transfer money to my China Bank account. Xurry is using David's paypal, so maybe it would be best if we don't need to involve David in.

Dear Adeh and Ulrich, could you please see if this work fine with you guys?



I ended up being able to cancel the $4000 recurring transfer, and don’t see any evidence that any $4000 transfers actually went out. 

CATHY: OK, Thanks for checking, I just wanna mask sure the $4000 is trackable.

Did you hear anything from the recipient bank about this having been returned? 
I’m 90% sure it was never sent. 


Meanwhile, apparently the $6000 transfers was returned, and the $5980 one was not returned so you should have received that. 

CATHY: Correct, we have received the $5980 payment, and this is the only one payment we received so far.

Dear Andre,

I hope this email finds you well.

Today, I want to discuss the importance of web accessibility for your website.
With over a billion people worldwide living with disabilities, it's crucial that we create websites that are easy to use for everyone.

Web accessibility means designing and developing websites that can be used by people with disabilities,
such as those who are blind, deaf, or have limited mobility.

This involves creating content that can be easily accessed using assistive technologies, such as screen readers or keyboard-only navigation.

There are several benefits to creating an accessible website.
For one, it ensures that your website is inclusive and reaches the broadest possible audience.

It also helps you comply with accessibility laws and regulations, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),
which requires businesses to provide equal access to their goods and services.

Additionally, an accessible website can improve the user experience for all users, not just those with disabilities.

It can make your website more user-friendly, faster to navigate, and easier to use across different devices and platforms.

In this email series, we'll cover the basics of web accessibility and how it can benefit your website and your users.

"Read this passage and confirm with ""OK"": Extract from ‘Down and Out in Paris and London’ by George Orwell (1933).
In this edited extract from a memoir of his time living in poverty in Paris and London, George
Orwell describes when most of his money is stolen from his lodgings in Paris. He is left with
only forty-seven francs (French money) to live on, and he explains how people can live in the
city spending just six francs a day.
It is altogether curious, your first contact with poverty. You have thought so much about
poverty–it is the thing you have feared all your life, the thing you knew would happen to
you sooner or later; and it is all so utterly different. You thought it would be quite simple;
it is extraordinarily complicated.
You discover, for instance, the secrecy attached to poverty. At a sudden stroke you have
been reduced to an income of six francs a day. But of course you dare not admit it–you
have got to pretend that you are living quite as usual. From the start it tangles you in a
net of lies, and even with the lies you can hardly manage it. You stop sending clothes
to the laundry, and the laundry worker catches you in the street and asks you why; you
mumble something, and she, thinking you are sending the clothes elsewhere, is your
enemy for life. The tobacconist* keeps asking why you have cut down your smoking.
There are letters you want to answer, and cannot, because stamps are too expensive.
And then there are your meals–meals are the worst difficulty of all. Your food is bread
and margarine, or bread and wine, and even the nature of the food is governed by lies.
You have to buy rye bread instead of household bread, because the rye loaves, though
dearer**, are round and can be smuggled in your pockets. This wastes you a franc a
day. Sometimes, to keep up appearances, you have to spend money on a drink, and go
correspondingly short of food. Your linen gets filthy, and you run out of soap and razorblades. Your hair wants cutting, and you try to cut it yourself, with such fearful results that
you have to go to the barber after all, and spend the equivalent of a day’s food. All day
you are telling lies, and expensive lies.
You discover the extreme precariousness of your six francs a day. Mean disasters happen
and rob you of food. You have spent your last money on half a litre of milk, and are
boiling it over the spirit lamp. While it boils a bug runs down your forearm; you give the
bug a flick with your nail, and it falls plop! straight into the milk. There is nothing for it
but to throw the milk away and go foodless.
You discover what it is like to be hungry. With bread and margarine in your belly, you
go out and look into the shop windows. Everywhere there is food insulting you in huge,
wasteful piles; whole dead pigs, baskets of hot loaves, great yellow blocks of butter,
strings of sausages, mountains of potatoes, vast cheeses like grindstones. A snivelling
self-pity comes over you at the sight of so much food.",none,0.3619382012511877

Channel CTR is the number of clicks on all of the videos on a channel divided by the number of times all the videos on that channel were shown.Some other strategies to increase YouTube CTR include:Having a catchy, attention-grabbing titleUsing keywords in your title and description to help your video show up in search resultsLeveraging playlists and end screens to increase the visibility and watch time of your videosOptimizing your video's metadata, including titles, descriptions, and tagsEncourage viewers to like and share your videosUse annotations, cards, and other interactive elements to encourage engagement and drive clicks to your website or other videos.It is worth mentioning that boosting CTR is not the only metric you should focus on, other metric should be considered like retention rate, bounce rate, watch time, engagement, etc. Creating a good video that people will want to watch is important for the success of the video, but also the audience will be more likely to share, comment, or subscribe to the channel.Web search results:

of the memory array; four versus six colored shapes, respectively.

FEATURE-BASED ATTENTION REGULATES VWM PERFORMANCE 1845
Experiment 1b was conducted to address a potential ceiling effect
noted in Experiment 1a. We analyze and report both experiments
together.
Participants. Sixty-six undergraduate students (33 in each of
Experiment 1a and Experiment 1b) from the University of Guelph
between the ages of 17 and 27 years (M  18.40) participated for
partial course credit. All participants reported having normal or
corrected-to-normal vision and no color blindness.
Stimuli and apparatus. The stimuli and apparatus were identical in Experiments 1a and 1b aside from noted exceptions.
Participants reported the colors of memory items using a 360°
color wheel. The color wheel used in all reported experiments was
created based on the CIELAB color space with the intention that
colors would differ only in hue and not in luminance, and the
perceptual difference between two adjacent colors anywhere on
the wheel would be comparable. In Experiment 1a, this color
wheel was not calibrated to the specific monitors used; however,
this limitation was remedied in Experiments 1b and 2, in which
experimental monitors were assessed using a colorimeter (Konica
Minolta CS-100A; Konica Minolta Sensing Americas, Inc., Ramsey, New Jersey) and the color wheel was adjusted for each
monitor. The colors of memory items on each trial were randomly
selected from the color wheel with the constraint that all colors
were separated by a minimum of 40° on the wheel. All stimuli
were viewed on a 1,280  1,024 cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor
using a 75-Hz refresh rate with a gray background, and viewing
distance was fixed at 57 cm using a head and chin rest.
Procedure. On each trial participants were shown a memory
array for 300 msec (see Figure 1). The memory array in Experiment 1a comprised two squares and two circles (each 1.2° in width
and height) placed randomly in four of eight possible positions
spaced equally around an invisible circle with a 5.5° diameter that
was centered on a central fixation point with a 0.07° radius. The
memory array in Experiment 1b comprised three squares and three
circles, and we increased the eccentricity of stimuli to 8° to reduce
crowding. After a 900-msec delay, a probe screen was displayed,
which presented the black outline of all four shapes in their
original spatial locations surrounded by the color wheel, the outer
edge of which was 12° from fixation. Participants were asked to
report the color of a probed (outlined in a thick black line) shape
as it had appeared in the preceding memory array by clicking the
corresponding color on the color wheel. The orientation of the
color wheel was randomized on each trial. This probe screen
remained visible until participants made a response and was followed by a 500-msec intertrial interval.
Participants were instructed that for the duration of the experiment, memory items that were one shape (i.e., either squares or
circles) were more likely to be probed than the other; shape was
pseudo-counterbalanced across participants. Participants completed four blocks of 150 trials, and the likelihood that a highprobability shape would be probed was manipulated across blocks
to be 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90%. Participants were informed of this
probability at the outset of each block, and the order of the blocks
was randomized for each participant. Of note, this procedure
results in a large number of trials in which a high-probability
shape is probed and only a small number of trials in which the
low-probability shape is probed, especially for the 90% block.
For Experiments 1a and 1b, we were primarily interested in how
the probability manipulation affected memory for highprobability items; thus, our analyses focus on only trials in
which a high-probability item was probed, resulting in a fully
crossed, mixed design with one within-subjects factor (ProbaFigure 1. Example trial sequence for Experiment 1a. Actual background color was gray. See the online article

bility: 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%) and one between-subjects factor
(Experiment: 1a vs. 1b).
Analysis. In all reported experiments, we assess VWM performance using several measures all based on raw response error
(i.e., the angular degree of distance between the color of the probed
item and the participant’s response). We first calculated the variability of responses for each probability condition by taking the
standard deviation of participants’ response errors (SDresponse).
Here, lower values reflect responses distributed more closely
around the target color, which we interpret as generally reflecting
more precise representations in VWM.
Using a three-parameter mixture model (Bays et al., 2009), we
further broke raw response errors down into three separate components that each reflect different aspects of VWM performance.
This model asserts that three different distributions contribute to
the likelihood of a given response: a uniform distribution reflecting
the proportion of random guesses; a von Mises distribution reflecting the proportion of responses centered around the actual color of
the probed item, the standard deviation of which is inversely
related to VWM fidelity; and the proportion of reports that are
centered around nonprobed items (i.e., “swap” reports of nontargets, likely a consequence of a spatial binding error). To account
for these nontarget errors, Bays and colleagues developed this
three-parameter mixture model from the standard two-parameter
mixture model proposed by Zhang and Luck (2008a), which included only a uniform distribution and a von Mises distribution.
For the precise mathematical definition of this model, see Equation
2 in Bays et al. (2009). We used maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE) to decompose raw errors into these three parameters via
MATLAB and the MemToolBox library (Suchow, Brady, Fougnie, & Alvarez, 2013).
It has been argued that some variability in memory performance
is a consequence of random fluctuations in memory fidelity across
items within a trial, and this source of variance is captured in a
class of models termed variable precision models (Fougnie,
Suchow, & Alvarez, 2012; van den Berg, Shin, Chou, George, &
Ma, 2012). To assess whether any observed effects of our probability manipulation are influenced by also accounting for random
fluctuations in fidelity, we modeled SDresponse using a variable
precision model that has been previously shown to provide a good
account of memory performance—the VP-A-NT model reported
by van den Berg et al. (2014). This model assumes that memory is
a continuous resource distributed across all memory items and, as
such, it does not include a parameter reflecting random guesses.
However, this model does estimate how an item’s precision (J

)
changes as a power-law function () of the number of memorized
items. Furthermore, along with the contribution of random fluctuations in memory fidelity, this model estimates how the likelihood
of making nontarget errors changes with set size (NTslope). Model
fitting was accomplished via MATLAB and a collection of functions provided by van den Berg et al. (2014). Of note, the code was
adjusted to allow for our probability manipulation to replace the
traditional set size manipulation; to accomplish this we input “set
size” as the inverse of probability (Emrich et al., in press). Our
primary interest was whether this variable precision model would
reveal comparable effects of our probability manipulation on precision () and nontarget errors (NTslope) to those revealed by the
three-parameter mixture model.",none,0.32072936916422706

which presented the black outline of all four shapes in their
original spatial locations surrounded by the color wheel, the outer
edge of which was 12° from fixation. Participants were asked to
report the color of a probed (outlined in a thick black line) shape
as it had appeared in the preceding memory array by clicking the
corresponding color on the color wheel. The orientation of the
color wheel was randomized on each trial. This probe screen
remained visible until participants made a response and was followed by a 500-msec intertrial interval.
Participants were instructed that for the duration of the experiment, memory items that were one shape (i.e., either squares or
circles) were more likely to be probed than the other; shape was
pseudo-counterbalanced across participants. Participants completed four blocks of 150 trials, and the likelihood that a highprobability shape would be probed was manipulated across blocks
to be 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90%. Participants were informed of this
probability at the outset of each block, and the order of the blocks
was randomized for each participant. Of note, this procedure
results in a large number of trials in which a high-probability
shape is probed and only a small number of trials in which the
low-probability shape is probed, especially for the 90% block.
For Experiments 1a and 1b, we were primarily interested in how
the probability manipulation affected memory for highprobability items; thus, our analyses focus on only trials in
which a high-probability item was probed, resulting in a fully
crossed, mixed design with one within-subjects factor (ProbaFigure 1. Example trial sequence for Experiment 1a. Actual background color was gray. See the online article

bility: 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%) and one between-subjects factor
(Experiment: 1a vs. 1b).
Analysis. In all reported experiments, we assess VWM performance using several measures all based on raw response error
(i.e., the angular degree of distance between the color of the probed
item and the participant’s response). We first calculated the variability of responses for each probability condition by taking the
standard deviation of participants’ response errors (SDresponse).
Here, lower values reflect responses distributed more closely
around the target color, which we interpret as generally reflecting
more precise representations in VWM.
Using a three-parameter mixture model (Bays et al., 2009), we
further broke raw response errors down into three separate components that each reflect different aspects of VWM performance.
This model asserts that three different distributions contribute to
the likelihood of a given response: a uniform distribution reflecting
the proportion of random guesses; a von Mises distribution reflecting the proportion of responses centered around the actual color of
the probed item, the standard deviation of which is inversely
related to VWM fidelity; and the proportion of reports that are
centered around nonprobed items (i.e., “swap” reports of nontargets, likely a consequence of a spatial binding error). To account
for these nontarget errors, Bays and colleagues developed this
three-parameter mixture model from the standard two-parameter
mixture model proposed by Zhang and Luck (2008a), which included only a uniform distribution and a von Mises distribution.
For the precise mathematical definition of this model, see Equation
2 in Bays et al. (2009). We used maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE) to decompose raw errors into these three parameters via
MATLAB and the MemToolBox library (Suchow, Brady, Fougnie, & Alvarez, 2013).
It has been argued that some variability in memory performance
is a consequence of random fluctuations in memory fidelity across
items within a trial, and this source of variance is captured in a
class of models termed variable precision models (Fougnie,
Suchow, & Alvarez, 2012; van den Berg, Shin, Chou, George, &
Ma, 2012). To assess whether any observed effects of our probability manipulation are influenced by also accounting for random
fluctuations in fidelity, we modeled SDresponse using a variable
precision model that has been previously shown to provide a good
account of memory performance—the VP-A-NT model reported
by van den Berg et al. (2014). This model assumes that memory is
a continuous resource distributed across all memory items and, as
such, it does not include a parameter reflecting random guesses.
However, this model does estimate how an item’s precision (J

)
changes as a power-law function () of the number of memorized
items. Furthermore, along with the contribution of random fluctuations in memory fidelity, this model estimates how the likelihood
of making nontarget errors changes with set size (NTslope). Model
fitting was accomplished via MATLAB and a collection of functions provided by van den Berg et al. (2014). Of note, the code was
adjusted to allow for our probability manipulation to replace the
traditional set size manipulation; to accomplish this we input “set
size” as the inverse of probability (Emrich et al., in press). Our
primary interest was whether this variable precision model would
reveal comparable effects of our probability manipulation on precision () and nontarget errors (NTslope) to those revealed by the
three-parameter mixture model.",v1,0.6783413788464596

FEATURE-BASED ATTENTION REGULATES VWM PERFORMANCE 1845
Experiment 1b was conducted to address a potential ceiling effect
noted in Experiment 1a. We analyze and report both experiments
together.
Participants. Sixty-six undergraduate students (33 in each of
Experiment 1a and Experiment 1b) from the University of Guelph
between the ages of 17 and 27 years (M  18.40) participated for
partial course credit. All participants reported having normal or
corrected-to-normal vision and no color blindness.
Stimuli and apparatus. The stimuli and apparatus were identical in Experiments 1a and 1b aside from noted exceptions.
Participants reported the colors of memory items using a 360°
color wheel. The color wheel used in all reported experiments was
created based on the CIELAB color space with the intention that
colors would differ only in hue and not in luminance, and the
perceptual difference between two adjacent colors anywhere on
the wheel would be comparable. In Experiment 1a, this color
wheel was not calibrated to the specific monitors used; however,
this limitation was remedied in Experiments 1b and 2, in which
experimental monitors were assessed using a colorimeter (Konica
Minolta CS-100A; Konica Minolta Sensing Americas, Inc., Ramsey, New Jersey) and the color wheel was adjusted for each
monitor. The colors of memory items on each trial were randomly
selected from the color wheel with the constraint that all colors
were separated by a minimum of 40° on the wheel. All stimuli
were viewed on a 1,280  1,024 cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor
using a 75-Hz refresh rate with a gray background, and viewing
distance was fixed at 57 cm using a head and chin rest.
Procedure. On each trial participants were shown a memory
array for 300 msec (see Figure 1). The memory array in Experiment 1a comprised two squares and two circles (each 1.2° in width
and height) placed randomly in four of eight possible positions
spaced equally around an invisible circle with a 5.5° diameter that
was centered on a central fixation point with a 0.07° radius. The
memory array in Experiment 1b comprised three squares and three
circles, and we increased the eccentricity of stimuli to 8° to reduce
crowding. After a 900-msec delay, a probe screen was displayed,
which presented the black outline of all four shapes in their
original spatial locations surrounded by the color wheel, the outer
edge of which was 12° from fixation. Participants were asked to
report the color of a probed (outlined in a thick black line) shape

 Notice to Owner 
Under the California Mechanics Lien Law any contractor, subcontractor, laborer, supplies or other persona  who helps to improve your property but is not paid for his/her work or supplies, has a right to enforce a claim  against your property. This means that after a court hearing, your property could be sold by a court officer  and the proceeds of the sale used to satisfy the indebtedness. This can happen even if you have paid your  contractor in full the subcontractors, laborers, or suppliers remain unpaid.  
To preserve their right to file a claim or lien against your property, certain claimants such as subcontractors or  materials suppliers are required to provide you with a document entitled “Preliminary Notice.” Original (or  prime) contractors and laborers for wages do not have to provide this notice. A Preliminary Notice is not a  lien against your property if they are not paid. (Generally, the maximum time allowed for filing a claim or lien  against your property is ninety (90) days after completion of your project.)

 Notice to Owner 
Under the California Mechanics Lien Law any contractor, subcontractor, laborer, supplies or other persona  who helps to improve your property but is not paid for his/her work or supplies, has a right to enforce a claim  against your property. This means that after a court hearing, your property could be sold by a court officer  and the proceeds of the sale used to satisfy the indebtedness. This can happen even if you have paid your  contractor in full the subcontractors, laborers, or suppliers remain unpaid.  
To preserve their right to file a claim or lien against your property, certain claimants such as subcontractors or  materials suppliers are required to provide you with a document entitled “Preliminary Notice.” Original (or  prime) contractors and laborers for wages do not have to provide this notice. A Preliminary Notice is not a  lien against your property if they are not paid. (Generally, the maximum time allowed for filing a claim or lien  against your property is ninety (90) days after completion of your project.)

"The mystery of Chinese savings

 HYPERLINK ""http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/146"" Shang-Jin Wei     6 February 2010, VOX.EU
What is the connection between China’s one-child policy and its savings glut? This column provides a pioneering explanation. China’s surplus of men has produced a highly competitive marriage market, driving up China’s savings rate and, therefore, global imbalances.

Much attention has been directed toward China’s high savings rate (Broda et al. 2009, Prasad 2009, Reisen 2009). Not only is the savings rate disproportionately high compared to virtually any other country, but it directly impacts China’s current account surplus and the US consumer debt and trade deficit. When national savings exceeds investment, the excess savings becomes China’s current account surplus.

Given its far-reaching effects, both private sector analysts and policymakers have attempted to trace the causes of China’s high savings rate and to predict how long it will last. Some have attributed the savings primarily to Chinese corporations. Others point to a precautionary savings motive – as Chinese are worried about costs of healthcare, education, and old-age pensions and are unsure about how much these costs might change over time, they save more.

But these explanations may not be the most important part of the story. For example, while the Chinese corporate savings rate is high, the pattern is consistent with many countries. For example, Korea and Japan always have an even higher corporate savings rate than China. In fact, corporate savings rates in most countries have experienced a steady rise in the recent decades. In research with Tam Bayoumi and Hui Tong (2009), we show that to understand why China’s national savings rate is so high, the corporate sector is the wrong place to start.

A marriage proposal
It is the high Chinese household savings that has no equal among major economies. As to explanations related to poor social safety net, they have trouble being reconciled with the improvements in the pension system, health insurance, and other government programs in recent years. Yes, the Chinese social safety net is still poor. Yes, part of the Chinese savings is to make up for the inadequacy of the social safety net. Yes, there may be some increase in the cost of healthcare. But, as the social safety has improved and the insurance coverage has expanded over the last decade or so, we should expect household savings to decline, or at least not increase. Yet, household savings as a share of disposable income almost doubled from 16% in 1990 to over 30% today.

In my recent research paper with Xiaobo Zhang (Wei and Zhang 2009), we hypothesised that a social phenomenon is the primary driver of the high savings rate. For the last few decades China has experienced a significant rise in the imbalance between the number of male and female children born to its citizens.

There are approximately 122 boys born for every 100 girls today, a ratio that means about one in five Chinese men will be cut out of the marriage market when this generation of children grows up. A variety of factors conspire to produce the imbalance. For example, Chinese parents often prefer sons. Ultra-sound makes it easy for parents to detect the gender of a foetus and abort the child that’s not the “right” sex for them, especially as China’s stringent family-planning policy allows most couples to have only one or two children.

Our study compared savings data across regions and in households with sons versus those with daughters. We found that not only did households with sons save more than households with daughters on average, but that households with sons tend to raise their savings rate if they also happen to live in a region with a more skewed gender ratio. Even those not competing in the marriage market must compete to buy housing and make other significant purchases, pushing up the savings rate for all households.

Cross-regional evidence
In Figure 1, we have plotted the time series of the (standardised) Chinese private sector savings rate (in red), defined as GDP less private and government consumption over GDP, from 1975 to 2005 against the (standardised) gender ratio at birth lagged by twenty years (i.e., 1955-1985) (in blue). There is a strikingly close connection between the two variables. The savings rate started to shoot up around 2002 just as the gender ratio for the marriage-age cohort began to be seriously out of balance. We show that this is more than a coincidence.

Figure 1. Chinese private sector savings rate vs private savings 1955-2005
 INCLUDEPICTURE ""http://www.voxeu.org/sites/default/files/image/wei%20fig%201.JPG"" \* MERGEFORMATINET 

First, in panel regressions across 30 Chinese provinces during 1990-2007, the local savings rate tends to be higher in regions and years in which the local gender ratio is higher. This continues to be true after we control for local income level, income inequality, the enrolment in the social security system, the age profile of the local population, and the province and year fixed effects.
Second, we recognise possible endogeneity of, and measurement error in, local gender ratios, and employ an instrumental approach. Gender ratio imbalance comes primarily from sex-selective abortions. This, in turn, results from a combination of parental preference for sons, and some limit to the number of children a couple is allowed or wants to have (which for the Chinese is a strict family-planning policy).

As suggested by other scholars, we use two measures of local financial penalties for violating family-planning policies – set more than a decade earlier – as instrumental variables for local gender ratio imbalance for the pre-marriage age cohort. As an extension, we also add the fraction of the local population that is legally exempted from the family-planning policy as an additional instrument. With either set of instruments, the effect of local gender ratios on local savings rates remains positive and statistically significant. In fact, the point estimate becomes larger. This suggests that an increasing imbalance in the gender ratio causes a rise in the savings rate.

Based on the point estimate in the instrumental regression, a rise in the gender ratio for the pre-marital age cohort from 1.05 to 1.14 (which is the mean increase across the provinces from 1990-2007) would lead to a rise in the savings rate by 6.7 percentage points, which is about 42% of the actual increase in the savings rate. If we run separate regressions for rural and urban areas, we find that the elasticity of the local savings rate with respect to the local gender ratio is larger in rural areas than in urban areas. An increase in the local gender ratio from 1.05 to 1.14 in the rural areas (the actual mean increase from 1990 to 2007) could account for about 49% of the actual increase in the savings rate.

Household-level evidence
We then examine household data using household surveys that cover 122 rural counties and 70 cities in 2002. While households with a son typically save more than households with a daughter, we do not regard this per se as supportive evidence of our hypothesis, since other channels could account for this difference. Instead, the evidence that we find more compelling is that savings by otherwise identical households with a son are greater in regions with a higher local gender ratio. This is something clearly predicted by our hypothesis, but not by any other existing explanations. In addition, we find that savings by households with a daughter do not decline in regions with a high gender ratio. This is consistent with the possibility pointed out in the model that the two opposing effects approximately cancel each other out. It is also consistent with the possibility that the savings pressure on households with a son spills over to other types of households.

With household-level data, we can control for a variety of household features that allow us to measure the importance of lifecycle factors (e.g., the age structure of the family members) and the precautionary savings motive (education level of the household head, whether any member of the household works in a government sector, has lost a job, or has experienced major illness). We find no robust support for the lifecycle hypothesis and some support for the precautionary savings motive. Indeed, the quantitative effect of a rise in the gender ratio on the savings rate is unaffected by controlling for these factors.

Still, could the local gender ratio reflect some omitted or unobserved variables that also affect the household savings decision? One may imagine that a region with more intrinsic income uncertainty, or a greater local aversion to a given uncertainty, may simultaneously exhibit a higher local gender ratio imbalance and a higher local savings rate. Can we rule this out? Yes. A pure location-specific shock should affect savings by all households in the same region in the same way. But that is not what we find. Instead, only the savings by those households with a son react strongly and positively to a rise in the local gender ratio, while savings by households with a daughter do not.

The next possibility is far more challenging. Could a gender ratio imbalance reflect something that is both location and household specific? For example, a region may have an unusually high level of income uncertainty that is common to all households, but some households care about this more than others. Those with a stronger aversion to uncertainty may engage in a sex-selective abortion more aggressively and save more at the same time. By construction, selection at both household and location level is much harder to rule out since our unit of observation is at the same level. But there are good reasons to think that if we focus on households with a single child, such selection is unlikely to be quantitatively significant. Ebenstein (2009) shows that gender ratio imbalance is overwhelmingly a result of sex-selective abortions at higher orders of birth. That is, the gender ratio for first-born children is close to normal. This is particularly true in rural areas. 

Since a second child is officially permitted if the first child is a girl, and since many families exhibit a preference for a balanced gender ratio (one boy and one girl) over having two boys, there is very little reason to perform sex-selective abortions on the first pregnancy. However, the gender ratio at birth goes up substantially over time for the second-born children and becomes even more skewed for higher order births. This pattern is also pointed out by Zhu, Lu and Hesketh (2009) in an article in the British Medical Journal. This suggests that the first son (or daughter) is unlikely to result from a sex-selective abortion. In our empirical examination, when we restrict attention to households with only one child, we still see that those with a son exhibit a strongly positive elasticity of savings with respect to the local gender ratio, but those with a daughter do not. Furthermore, savings by a household with a son are more sensitive to the gender ratio in rural areas.

Policy implications
While the conventional explanations for the high savings rate all play a role, this new research indicates those explanations are not as important as people previously thought. While sociologists and other social scientists have looked at the gender ratio imbalance as a social problem, they have not looked at it in relation to the high Chinese savings rate. Similarly, as economists and policymakers have looked with concern to the large Chinese current account surplus and large US current account deficit, or global imbalances, much of their discussion has focused on changing exchange rate policy.
None of the discussion about global imbalances has brought family-planning policy or women’s rights to the table, because many do not see these issues as related to economic policy. Our research suggests that this is a serious omission. You can only implement the right policy when you have the appropriate diagnosis, and fruitful policy dialogue has to include discussion on these issues.

"The mystery of Chinese savings

What is the connection between China’s one-child policy and its savings glut? This column provides a pioneering explanation. China’s surplus of men has produced a highly competitive marriage market, driving up China’s savings rate and, therefore, global imbalances.

Much attention has been directed toward China’s high savings rate (Broda et al. 2009, Prasad 2009, Reisen 2009). Not only is the savings rate disproportionately high compared to virtually any other country, but it directly impacts China’s current account surplus and the US consumer debt and trade deficit. When national savings exceeds investment, the excess savings becomes China’s current account surplus.

Given its far-reaching effects, both private sector analysts and policymakers have attempted to trace the causes of China’s high savings rate and to predict how long it will last. Some have attributed the savings primarily to Chinese corporations. Others point to a precautionary savings motive – as Chinese are worried about costs of healthcare, education, and old-age pensions and are unsure about how much these costs might change over time, they save more.

But these explanations may not be the most important part of the story. For example, while the Chinese corporate savings rate is high, the pattern is consistent with many countries. For example, Korea and Japan always have an even higher corporate savings rate than China. In fact, corporate savings rates in most countries have experienced a steady rise in the recent decades. In research with Tam Bayoumi and Hui Tong (2009), we show that to understand why China’s national savings rate is so high, the corporate sector is the wrong place to start.

A marriage proposal
It is the high Chinese household savings that has no equal among major economies. As to explanations related to poor social safety net, they have trouble being reconciled with the improvements in the pension system, health insurance, and other government programs in recent years. Yes, the Chinese social safety net is still poor. Yes, part of the Chinese savings is to make up for the inadequacy of the social safety net. Yes, there may be some increase in the cost of healthcare. But, as the social safety has improved and the insurance coverage has expanded over the last decade or so, we should expect household savings to decline, or at least not increase. Yet, household savings as a share of disposable income almost doubled from 16% in 1990 to over 30% today.

In my recent research paper with Xiaobo Zhang (Wei and Zhang 2009), we hypothesised that a social phenomenon is the primary driver of the high savings rate. For the last few decades China has experienced a significant rise in the imbalance between the number of male and female children born to its citizens.

There are approximately 122 boys born for every 100 girls today, a ratio that means about one in five Chinese men will be cut out of the marriage market when this generation of children grows up. A variety of factors conspire to produce the imbalance. For example, Chinese parents often prefer sons. Ultra-sound makes it easy for parents to detect the gender of a foetus and abort the child that’s not the “right” sex for them, especially as China’s stringent family-planning policy allows most couples to have only one or two children.

Our study compared savings data across regions and in households with sons versus those with daughters. We found that not only did households with sons save more than households with daughters on average, but that households with sons tend to raise their savings rate if they also happen to live in a region with a more skewed gender ratio. Even those not competing in the marriage market must compete to buy housing and make other significant purchases, pushing up the savings rate for all households.

Cross-regional evidence
In Figure 1, we have plotted the time series of the (standardised) Chinese private sector savings rate (in red), defined as GDP less private and government consumption over GDP, from 1975 to 2005 against the (standardised) gender ratio at birth lagged by twenty years (i.e., 1955-1985) (in blue). There is a strikingly close connection between the two variables. The savings rate started to shoot up around 2002 just as the gender ratio for the marriage-age cohort began to be seriously out of balance. We show that this is more than a coincidence.

First, in panel regressions across 30 Chinese provinces during 1990-2007, the local savings rate tends to be higher in regions and years in which the local gender ratio is higher. This continues to be true after we control for local income level, income inequality, the enrolment in the social security system, the age profile of the local population, and the province and year fixed effects.
Second, we recognise possible endogeneity of, and measurement error in, local gender ratios, and employ an instrumental approach. Gender ratio imbalance comes primarily from sex-selective abortions. This, in turn, results from a combination of parental preference for sons, and some limit to the number of children a couple is allowed or wants to have (which for the Chinese is a strict family-planning policy).

As suggested by other scholars, we use two measures of local financial penalties for violating family-planning policies – set more than a decade earlier – as instrumental variables for local gender ratio imbalance for the pre-marriage age cohort. As an extension, we also add the fraction of the local population that is legally exempted from the family-planning policy as an additional instrument. With either set of instruments, the effect of local gender ratios on local savings rates remains positive and statistically significant. In fact, the point estimate becomes larger. This suggests that an increasing imbalance in the gender ratio causes a rise in the savings rate.

Based on the point estimate in the instrumental regression, a rise in the gender ratio for the pre-marital age cohort from 1.05 to 1.14 (which is the mean increase across the provinces from 1990-2007) would lead to a rise in the savings rate by 6.7 percentage points, which is about 42% of the actual increase in the savings rate. If we run separate regressions for rural and urban areas, we find that the elasticity of the local savings rate with respect to the local gender ratio is larger in rural areas than in urban areas. An increase in the local gender ratio from 1.05 to 1.14 in the rural areas (the actual mean increase from 1990 to 2007) could account for about 49% of the actual increase in the savings rate.

Household-level evidence
We then examine household data using household surveys that cover 122 rural counties and 70 cities in 2002. While households with a son typically save more than households with a daughter, we do not regard this per se as supportive evidence of our hypothesis, since other channels could account for this difference. Instead, the evidence that we find more compelling is that savings by otherwise identical households with a son are greater in regions with a higher local gender ratio. This is something clearly predicted by our hypothesis, but not by any other existing explanations. In addition, we find that savings by households with a daughter do not decline in regions with a high gender ratio. This is consistent with the possibility pointed out in the model that the two opposing effects approximately cancel each other out. It is also consistent with the possibility that the savings pressure on households with a son spills over to other types of households.

With household-level data, we can control for a variety of household features that allow us to measure the importance of lifecycle factors (e.g., the age structure of the family members) and the precautionary savings motive (education level of the household head, whether any member of the household works in a government sector, has lost a job, or has experienced major illness). We find no robust support for the lifecycle hypothesis and some support for the precautionary savings motive. Indeed, the quantitative effect of a rise in the gender ratio on the savings rate is unaffected by controlling for these factors.

Still, could the local gender ratio reflect some omitted or unobserved variables that also affect the household savings decision? One may imagine that a region with more intrinsic income uncertainty, or a greater local aversion to a given uncertainty, may simultaneously exhibit a higher local gender ratio imbalance and a higher local savings rate. Can we rule this out? Yes. A pure location-specific shock should affect savings by all households in the same region in the same way. But that is not what we find. Instead, only the savings by those households with a son react strongly and positively to a rise in the local gender ratio, while savings by households with a daughter do not.

The next possibility is far more challenging. Could a gender ratio imbalance reflect something that is both location and household specific? For example, a region may have an unusually high level of income uncertainty that is common to all households, but some households care about this more than others. Those with a stronger aversion to uncertainty may engage in a sex-selective abortion more aggressively and save more at the same time. By construction, selection at both household and location level is much harder to rule out since our unit of observation is at the same level. But there are good reasons to think that if we focus on households with a single child, such selection is unlikely to be quantitatively significant. Ebenstein (2009) shows that gender ratio imbalance is overwhelmingly a result of sex-selective abortions at higher orders of birth. That is, the gender ratio for first-born children is close to normal. This is particularly true in rural areas. 

Since a second child is officially permitted if the first child is a girl, and since many families exhibit a preference for a balanced gender ratio (one boy and one girl) over having two boys, there is very little reason to perform sex-selective abortions on the first pregnancy. However, the gender ratio at birth goes up substantially over time for the second-born children and becomes even more skewed for higher order births.

By construction, selection at both household and location level is much harder to rule out since our unit of observation is at the same level. But there are good reasons to think that if we focus on households with a single child, such selection is unlikely to be quantitatively significant. Ebenstein (2009) shows that gender ratio imbalance is overwhelmingly a result of sex-selective abortions at higher orders of birth. That is, the gender ratio for first-born children is close to normal. This is particularly true in rural areas. 

Since a second child is officially permitted if the first child is a girl, and since many families exhibit a preference for a balanced gender ratio (one boy and one girl) over having two boys, there is very little reason to perform sex-selective abortions on the first pregnancy. However, the gender ratio at birth goes up substantially over time for the second-born children and becomes even more skewed for higher order births. This pattern is also pointed out by Zhu, Lu and Hesketh (2009) in an article in the British Medical Journal. This suggests that the first son (or daughter) is unlikely to result from a sex-selective abortion. In our empirical examination, when we restrict attention to households with only one child, we still see that those with a son exhibit a strongly positive elasticity of savings with respect to the local gender ratio, but those with a daughter do not. Furthermore, savings by a household with a son are more sensitive to the gender ratio in rural areas.

Policy implications
While the conventional explanations for the high savings rate all play a role, this new research indicates those explanations are not as important as people previously thought. While sociologists and other social scientists have looked at the gender ratio imbalance as a social problem, they have not looked at it in relation to the high Chinese savings rate. Similarly, as economists and policymakers have looked with concern to the large Chinese current account surplus and large US current account deficit, or global imbalances, much of their discussion has focused on changing exchange rate policy.
None of the discussion about global imbalances has brought family-planning policy or women’s rights to the table, because many do not see these issues as related to economic policy. Our research suggests that this is a serious omission. You can only implement the right policy when you have the appropriate diagnosis, and fruitful policy dialogue has to include discussion on these issues.

Essay assignment: Despite being quite poor, China currently has a savings rate that is much higher than most other countries in the world. An article by Shang-Jin Wei in VoxEU proposes one interesting reason why Chinese households tend to save so much. Do you find the article's evidence plausible? What other factors may explain why initially poor East Asian countries have saved at very high rates over the past sixty years?",base,0.5308344402601113

"We have the following blog content... what is the likely user intent of a searcher who lands on this page? Our goal should be to answer that intent better and faster than anyone else!

The content:

Consumers want more choices, but all those choices can be daunting. It gives the consumer the responsibility of educating themselves on the best option for their circumstances. On GigSalad, we deliver more than 600 categories of entertainment and event services for the ability to compare rates of various performers. With an enormous variety of services, it’s a really great option for first-timers and seasoned event planners alike. But with so many talented professionals out there, how do you choose? Budget may be a large factor in who you choose to book, but before you make your choice, here are 6 reasons for choosing the best entertainment, not the cheapest.

1. You get what you pay for.
Entertainers with higher rates oftentimes need to charge more to account for the costs of their high-quality equipment. Many performers set them based on their professional experience. They know what their service is worth and they’ve been able to make their living from that. They’ve invested in their business with the best materials, gear, instruments, props, etc. to give their clients most immersive experience. These materials can make a huge difference between one vendor and another.

Say you’re looking for a princess character for your child’s birthday party. To make a fairy tale come to life, performers need costumes and accessories that not only look pretty and authentic but also hold up to wear and tear. Along with the costs of dry cleaning, well-made costumes are a large investment for professional princess characters. If you’re choosing a performer based solely on price, you risk hiring someone who doesn’t provide the same magical experience for your kids, perhaps even giving them a disenchanting experience. A top-notch entertainer will deliver a performance that you and your family will remember for years to come.

 


 

Don’t let the sticker shock of good entertainment throw off your plans. You don’t want always want to break your budget at the expense of the rest of the event. Simply determine your priorities and set the spending from there. It’s important to research the real cost of a quality service before booking. If there is a significant drop-off between bids, then you can probably expect a drop-off in quality as well. Adjust your budget to your talent and quality expectations.

2. Professionals who are invested in their business are also invested in their clients.
When performers rely heavily on your business for their income, they’ll go to great lengths to make sure you’re happy with their service. Most of our GigSalad entertainers are self-employed, independent business people. They depend on good reviews and word of mouth for promotion and buzz.

Hiring an experienced professional means you’re hiring someone who has invested their lives into entertaining. Their goal is to make a living and provide you with a memorable event at the same time. Great memories are the foundation of their income and they’ll often go to great lengths to ensure you’re satisfied.

3. Pros know how to customize for your needs.
Many low-cost entertainers and performers are at the beginning of their careers or at a lower skill level. Often, this means that they offer a limited repertoire and fewer options as they are developing their craft. Your event is unique to you, therefore, you’ll need someone who can customize their act or services to your event. A good sign of a professional is their ability and willingness to reasonably adapt to your event needs.

4. Pros offer more than just entertainment. They give you peace of mind.
Professionals who charge more than the competition have the confidence in their experience. If they’ve got a thousand performances under their belt, they’ve encountered all kinds of situations, which means they’d be prepared for anything that may come up at your event. The ability to adapt and improvise is especially beneficial in unexpected situations that put your event at risk of turning into a disaster!


5. The difference in cost makes all the difference in the success of your event.
You’ve decided to take the risk and hire an entertainer for your event. Perhaps a strolling magician for the office party you were picked to plan. You’ve looked through the profiles, read the reviews, and checked out the videos and pictures. When the moment of decision comes, the temptation of saving a few bucks by hiring someone with fewer reviews and a lower quality presentation get very real very quickly. That’s money that could go to streamers! But those few dollars could mean the difference in the quality of your event and the likelihood of using entertainment again. A great professional turns the groans of “Remember last year? I hope that doesn’t happen again,” to the excitement of “Remember last year? I can’t wait to see what happens this time!” Paying a few extra bucks can prevent the dreaded buyer’s remorse.

6. There are no do-overs.
GigSalad’s mission is to help you Book Something Awesome. We recognize that many of the events we connect entertainers with are often once in a lifetime moments. That significance is one of the reasons we encourage you to take the time and research your providers well. You may not get a chance to do it again. We hope that you would take the few extra minutes necessary to thoroughly read the bids, examine the profiles, view the media, and make an educated decision. Don’t risk devaluing a critical life moment or celebration by going bargain hunting. If the price is right and the quality is high, invest in the memory.  

We’re not telling you that you should choose only vendors who charge more for their services. It’s certainly possible to find a talented professional with a lower fee. We’re simply encouraging you to do your homework. Look at their photos and videos, read reviews, ask them questions. Figure out why their rates are what they are. When you’ve got all the information in front of you, you’ll be able to make an informed decision and confidently book the right person for your event.",none,0.7902376239826912

Consumers want more choices, but all those choices can be daunting. It gives the consumer the responsibility of educating themselves on the best option for their circumstances. On GigSalad, we deliver more than 600 categories of entertainment and event services for the ability to compare rates of various performers. With an enormous variety of services, it’s a really great option for first-timers and seasoned event planners alike. But with so many talented professionals out there, how do you choose? Budget may be a large factor in who you choose to book, but before you make your choice, here are 6 reasons for choosing the best entertainment, not the cheapest.

1. You get what you pay for.
Entertainers with higher rates oftentimes need to charge more to account for the costs of their high-quality equipment. Many performers set them based on their professional experience. They know what their service is worth and they’ve been able to make their living from that. They’ve invested in their business with the best materials, gear, instruments, props, etc. to give their clients most immersive experience. These materials can make a huge difference between one vendor and another.

Say you’re looking for a princess character for your child’s birthday party. To make a fairy tale come to life, performers need costumes and accessories that not only look pretty and authentic but also hold up to wear and tear. Along with the costs of dry cleaning, well-made costumes are a large investment for professional princess characters. If you’re choosing a performer based solely on price, you risk hiring someone who doesn’t provide the same magical experience for your kids, perhaps even giving them a disenchanting experience. A top-notch entertainer will deliver a performance that you and your family will remember for years to come.

 


 

Don’t let the sticker shock of good entertainment throw off your plans. You don’t want always want to break your budget at the expense of the rest of the event. Simply determine your priorities and set the spending from there. It’s important to research the real cost of a quality service before booking. If there is a significant drop-off between bids, then you can probably expect a drop-off in quality as well. Adjust your budget to your talent and quality expectations.

2. Professionals who are invested in their business are also invested in their clients.
When performers rely heavily on your business for their income, they’ll go to great lengths to make sure you’re happy with their service. Most of our GigSalad entertainers are self-employed, independent business people. They depend on good reviews and word of mouth for promotion and buzz.

Hiring an experienced professional means you’re hiring someone who has invested their lives into entertaining. Their goal is to make a living and provide you with a memorable event at the same time. Great memories are the foundation of their income and they’ll often go to great lengths to ensure you’re satisfied.

3. Pros know how to customize for your needs.
Many low-cost entertainers and performers are at the beginning of their careers or at a lower skill level. Often, this means that they offer a limited repertoire and fewer options as they are developing their craft. Your event is unique to you, therefore, you’ll need someone who can customize their act or services to your event. A good sign of a professional is their ability and willingness to reasonably adapt to your event needs.

4. Pros offer more than just entertainment. They give you peace of mind.
Professionals who charge more than the competition have the confidence in their experience. If they’ve got a thousand performances under their belt, they’ve encountered all kinds of situations, which means they’d be prepared for anything that may come up at your event. The ability to adapt and improvise is especially beneficial in unexpected situations that put your event at risk of turning into a disaster!

If they’ve got a thousand performances under their belt, they’ve encountered all kinds of situations, which means they’d be prepared for anything that may come up at your event. The ability to adapt and improvise is especially beneficial in unexpected situations that put your event at risk of turning into a disaster!


5. The difference in cost makes all the difference in the success of your event.
You’ve decided to take the risk and hire an entertainer for your event. Perhaps a strolling magician for the office party you were picked to plan. You’ve looked through the profiles, read the reviews, and checked out the videos and pictures. When the moment of decision comes, the temptation of saving a few bucks by hiring someone with fewer reviews and a lower quality presentation get very real very quickly. That’s money that could go to streamers! But those few dollars could mean the difference in the quality of your event and the likelihood of using entertainment again. A great professional turns the groans of “Remember last year? I hope that doesn’t happen again,” to the excitement of “Remember last year? I can’t wait to see what happens this time!” Paying a few extra bucks can prevent the dreaded buyer’s remorse.

6. There are no do-overs.
GigSalad’s mission is to help you Book Something Awesome. We recognize that many of the events we connect entertainers with are often once in a lifetime moments. That significance is one of the reasons we encourage you to take the time and research your providers well. You may not get a chance to do it again. We hope that you would take the few extra minutes necessary to thoroughly read the bids, examine the profiles, view the media, and make an educated decision. Don’t risk devaluing a critical life moment or celebration by going bargain hunting. If the price is right and the quality is high, invest in the memory.  

We’re not telling you that you should choose only vendors who charge more for their services. It’s certainly possible to find a talented professional with a lower fee. We’re simply encouraging you to do your homework. Look at their photos and videos, read reviews, ask them questions. Figure out why their rates are what they are. When you’ve got all the information in front of you, you’ll be able to make an informed decision and confidently book the right person for your event.",v2,0.7793947890873584

Consumers want more choices, but all those choices can be daunting. It gives the consumer the responsibility of educating themselves on the best option for their circumstances. On GigSalad, we deliver more than 600 categories of entertainment and event services for the ability to compare rates of various performers. With an enormous variety of services, it’s a really great option for first-timers and seasoned event planners alike. But with so many talented professionals out there, how do you choose? Budget may be a large factor in who you choose to book, but before you make your choice, here are 6 reasons for choosing the best entertainment, not the cheapest.

1. You get what you pay for.
Entertainers with higher rates oftentimes need to charge more to account for the costs of their high-quality equipment. Many performers set them based on their professional experience. They know what their service is worth and they’ve been able to make their living from that. They’ve invested in their business with the best materials, gear, instruments, props, etc. to give their clients most immersive experience. These materials can make a huge difference between one vendor and another.

Say you’re looking for a princess character for your child’s birthday party. To make a fairy tale come to life, performers need costumes and accessories that not only look pretty and authentic but also hold up to wear and tear. Along with the costs of dry cleaning, well-made costumes are a large investment for professional princess characters. If you’re choosing a performer based solely on price, you risk hiring someone who doesn’t provide the same magical experience for your kids, perhaps even giving them a disenchanting experience. A top-notch entertainer will deliver a performance that you and your family will remember for years to come.

 


 

Don’t let the sticker shock of good entertainment throw off your plans. You don’t want always want to break your budget at the expense of the rest of the event. Simply determine your priorities and set the spending from there. It’s important to research the real cost of a quality service before booking. If there is a significant drop-off between bids, then you can probably expect a drop-off in quality as well. Adjust your budget to your talent and quality expectations.

2. Professionals who are invested in their business are also invested in their clients.
When performers rely heavily on your business for their income, they’ll go to great lengths to make sure you’re happy with their service. Most of our GigSalad entertainers are self-employed, independent business people. They depend on good reviews and word of mouth for promotion and buzz.

Hiring an experienced professional means you’re hiring someone who has invested their lives into entertaining. Their goal is to make a living and provide you with a memorable event at the same time. Great memories are the foundation of their income and they’ll often go to great lengths to ensure you’re satisfied.

3. Pros know how to customize for your needs.
Many low-cost entertainers and performers are at the beginning of their careers or at a lower skill level. Often, this means that they offer a limited repertoire and fewer options as they are developing their craft. Your event is unique to you, therefore, you’ll need someone who can customize their act or services to your event. A good sign of a professional is their ability and willingness to reasonably adapt to your event needs.

Often, this means that they offer a limited repertoire and fewer options as they are developing their craft. Your event is unique to you, therefore, you’ll need someone who can customize their act or services to your event. A good sign of a professional is their ability and willingness to reasonably adapt to your event needs.

4. Pros offer more than just entertainment. They give you peace of mind.
Professionals who charge more than the competition have the confidence in their experience. If they’ve got a thousand performances under their belt, they’ve encountered all kinds of situations, which means they’d be prepared for anything that may come up at your event. The ability to adapt and improvise is especially beneficial in unexpected situations that put your event at risk of turning into a disaster!


5. The difference in cost makes all the difference in the success of your event.
You’ve decided to take the risk and hire an entertainer for your event. Perhaps a strolling magician for the office party you were picked to plan. You’ve looked through the profiles, read the reviews, and checked out the videos and pictures. When the moment of decision comes, the temptation of saving a few bucks by hiring someone with fewer reviews and a lower quality presentation get very real very quickly. That’s money that could go to streamers! But those few dollars could mean the difference in the quality of your event and the likelihood of using entertainment again. A great professional turns the groans of “Remember last year? I hope that doesn’t happen again,” to the excitement of “Remember last year? I can’t wait to see what happens this time!” Paying a few extra bucks can prevent the dreaded buyer’s remorse.

6. There are no do-overs.
GigSalad’s mission is to help you Book Something Awesome. We recognize that many of the events we connect entertainers with are often once in a lifetime moments. That significance is one of the reasons we encourage you to take the time and research your providers well. You may not get a chance to do it again. We hope that you would take the few extra minutes necessary to thoroughly read the bids, examine the profiles, view the media, and make an educated decision. Don’t risk devaluing a critical life moment or celebration by going bargain hunting. If the price is right and the quality is high, invest in the memory.  

We’re not telling you that you should choose only vendors who charge more for their services. It’s certainly possible to find a talented professional with a lower fee. We’re simply encouraging you to do your homework. Look at their photos and videos, read reviews, ask them questions. Figure out why their rates are what they are. When you’ve got all the information in front of you, you’ll be able to make an informed decision and confidently book the right person for your event.",none,0.7902376239826912

Consumers want more choices, but all those choices can be daunting. It gives the consumer the responsibility of educating themselves on the best option for their circumstances. On GigSalad, we deliver more than 600 categories of entertainment and event services for the ability to compare rates of various performers. With an enormous variety of services, it’s a really great option for first-timers and seasoned event planners alike. But with so many talented professionals out there, how do you choose? Budget may be a large factor in who you choose to book, but before you make your choice, here are 6 reasons for choosing the best entertainment, not the cheapest.

1. You get what you pay for.
Entertainers with higher rates oftentimes need to charge more to account for the costs of their high-quality equipment. Many performers set them based on their professional experience. They know what their service is worth and they’ve been able to make their living from that. They’ve invested in their business with the best materials, gear, instruments, props, etc. to give their clients most immersive experience. These materials can make a huge difference between one vendor and another.

Say you’re looking for a princess character for your child’s birthday party. To make a fairy tale come to life, performers need costumes and accessories that not only look pretty and authentic but also hold up to wear and tear. Along with the costs of dry cleaning, well-made costumes are a large investment for professional princess characters. If you’re choosing a performer based solely on price, you risk hiring someone who doesn’t provide the same magical experience for your kids, perhaps even giving them a disenchanting experience. A top-notch entertainer will deliver a performance that you and your family will remember for years to come.

 


 

Don’t let the sticker shock of good entertainment throw off your plans. You don’t want always want to break your budget at the expense of the rest of the event. Simply determine your priorities and set the spending from there. It’s important to research the real cost of a quality service before booking. If there is a significant drop-off between bids, then you can probably expect a drop-off in quality as well. Adjust your budget to your talent and quality expectations.

2. Professionals who are invested in their business are also invested in their clients.
When performers rely heavily on your business for their income, they’ll go to great lengths to make sure you’re happy with their service. Most of our GigSalad entertainers are self-employed, independent business people. They depend on good reviews and word of mouth for promotion and buzz.

Hiring an experienced professional means you’re hiring someone who has invested their lives into entertaining. Their goal is to make a living and provide you with a memorable event at the same time. Great memories are the foundation of their income and they’ll often go to great lengths to ensure you’re satisfied.

Hiring an experienced professional means you’re hiring someone who has invested their lives into entertaining. Their goal is to make a living and provide you with a memorable event at the same time. Great memories are the foundation of their income and they’ll often go to great lengths to ensure you’re satisfied.

3. Pros know how to customize for your needs.
Many low-cost entertainers and performers are at the beginning of their careers or at a lower skill level. Often, this means that they offer a limited repertoire and fewer options as they are developing their craft. Your event is unique to you, therefore, you’ll need someone who can customize their act or services to your event. A good sign of a professional is their ability and willingness to reasonably adapt to your event needs.

4. Pros offer more than just entertainment. They give you peace of mind.
Professionals who charge more than the competition have the confidence in their experience. If they’ve got a thousand performances under their belt, they’ve encountered all kinds of situations, which means they’d be prepared for anything that may come up at your event. The ability to adapt and improvise is especially beneficial in unexpected situations that put your event at risk of turning into a disaster!


5. The difference in cost makes all the difference in the success of your event.
You’ve decided to take the risk and hire an entertainer for your event. Perhaps a strolling magician for the office party you were picked to plan. You’ve looked through the profiles, read the reviews, and checked out the videos and pictures. When the moment of decision comes, the temptation of saving a few bucks by hiring someone with fewer reviews and a lower quality presentation get very real very quickly. That’s money that could go to streamers! But those few dollars could mean the difference in the quality of your event and the likelihood of using entertainment again. A great professional turns the groans of “Remember last year? I hope that doesn’t happen again,” to the excitement of “Remember last year? I can’t wait to see what happens this time!” Paying a few extra bucks can prevent the dreaded buyer’s remorse.

6. There are no do-overs.
GigSalad’s mission is to help you Book Something Awesome. We recognize that many of the events we connect entertainers with are often once in a lifetime moments. That significance is one of the reasons we encourage you to take the time and research your providers well. You may not get a chance to do it again. We hope that you would take the few extra minutes necessary to thoroughly read the bids, examine the profiles, view the media, and make an educated decision. Don’t risk devaluing a critical life moment or celebration by going bargain hunting. If the price is right and the quality is high, invest in the memory.  

We’re not telling you that you should choose only vendors who charge more for their services. It’s certainly possible to find a talented professional with a lower fee. We’re simply encouraging you to do your homework. Look at their photos and videos, read reviews, ask them questions. Figure out why their rates are what they are. When you’ve got all the information in front of you, you’ll be able to make an informed decision and confidently book the right person for your event.",v2,0.7793947890873584

Consumers want more choices, but all those choices can be daunting. It gives the consumer the responsibility of educating themselves on the best option for their circumstances. On GigSalad, we deliver more than 600 categories of entertainment and event services for the ability to compare rates of various performers. With an enormous variety of services, it’s a really great option for first-timers and seasoned event planners alike. But with so many talented professionals out there, how do you choose? Budget may be a large factor in who you choose to book, but before you make your choice, here are 6 reasons for choosing the best entertainment, not the cheapest.

1. You get what you pay for.
Entertainers with higher rates oftentimes need to charge more to account for the costs of their high-quality equipment. Many performers set them based on their professional experience. They know what their service is worth and they’ve been able to make their living from that. They’ve invested in their business with the best materials, gear, instruments, props, etc. to give their clients most immersive experience. These materials can make a huge difference between one vendor and another.

Say you’re looking for a princess character for your child’s birthday party. To make a fairy tale come to life, performers need costumes and accessories that not only look pretty and authentic but also hold up to wear and tear. Along with the costs of dry cleaning, well-made costumes are a large investment for professional princess characters. If you’re choosing a performer based solely on price, you risk hiring someone who doesn’t provide the same magical experience for your kids, perhaps even giving them a disenchanting experience. A top-notch entertainer will deliver a performance that you and your family will remember for years to come.

 


 

Don’t let the sticker shock of good entertainment throw off your plans. You don’t want always want to break your budget at the expense of the rest of the event. Simply determine your priorities and set the spending from there. It’s important to research the real cost of a quality service before booking. If there is a significant drop-off between bids, then you can probably expect a drop-off in quality as well. Adjust your budget to your talent and quality expectations.

Simply determine your priorities and set the spending from there. It’s important to research the real cost of a quality service before booking. If there is a significant drop-off between bids, then you can probably expect a drop-off in quality as well. Adjust your budget to your talent and quality expectations.

2. Professionals who are invested in their business are also invested in their clients.
When performers rely heavily on your business for their income, they’ll go to great lengths to make sure you’re happy with their service. Most of our GigSalad entertainers are self-employed, independent business people. They depend on good reviews and word of mouth for promotion and buzz.

Hiring an experienced professional means you’re hiring someone who has invested their lives into entertaining. Their goal is to make a living and provide you with a memorable event at the same time. Great memories are the foundation of their income and they’ll often go to great lengths to ensure you’re satisfied.

3. Pros know how to customize for your needs.
Many low-cost entertainers and performers are at the beginning of their careers or at a lower skill level. Often, this means that they offer a limited repertoire and fewer options as they are developing their craft. Your event is unique to you, therefore, you’ll need someone who can customize their act or services to your event. A good sign of a professional is their ability and willingness to reasonably adapt to your event needs.

4. Pros offer more than just entertainment. They give you peace of mind.
Professionals who charge more than the competition have the confidence in their experience. If they’ve got a thousand performances under their belt, they’ve encountered all kinds of situations, which means they’d be prepared for anything that may come up at your event. The ability to adapt and improvise is especially beneficial in unexpected situations that put your event at risk of turning into a disaster!


5. The difference in cost makes all the difference in the success of your event.
You’ve decided to take the risk and hire an entertainer for your event. Perhaps a strolling magician for the office party you were picked to plan. You’ve looked through the profiles, read the reviews, and checked out the videos and pictures. When the moment of decision comes, the temptation of saving a few bucks by hiring someone with fewer reviews and a lower quality presentation get very real very quickly. That’s money that could go to streamers! But those few dollars could mean the difference in the quality of your event and the likelihood of using entertainment again. A great professional turns the groans of “Remember last year? I hope that doesn’t happen again,” to the excitement of “Remember last year? I can’t wait to see what happens this time!” Paying a few extra bucks can prevent the dreaded buyer’s remorse.

6. There are no do-overs.
GigSalad’s mission is to help you Book Something Awesome. We recognize that many of the events we connect entertainers with are often once in a lifetime moments. That significance is one of the reasons we encourage you to take the time and research your providers well. You may not get a chance to do it again. We hope that you would take the few extra minutes necessary to thoroughly read the bids, examine the profiles, view the media, and make an educated decision. Don’t risk devaluing a critical life moment or celebration by going bargain hunting. If the price is right and the quality is high, invest in the memory.  

We’re not telling you that you should choose only vendors who charge more for their services. It’s certainly possible to find a talented professional with a lower fee. We’re simply encouraging you to do your homework. Look at their photos and videos, read reviews, ask them questions. Figure out why their rates are what they are. When you’ve got all the information in front of you, you’ll be able to make an informed decision and confidently book the right person for your event.",none,0.7902376239826912

Consumers want more choices, but all those choices can be daunting. It gives the consumer the responsibility of educating themselves on the best option for their circumstances. On GigSalad, we deliver more than 600 categories of entertainment and event services for the ability to compare rates of various performers. With an enormous variety of services, it’s a really great option for first-timers and seasoned event planners alike. But with so many talented professionals out there, how do you choose? Budget may be a large factor in who you choose to book, but before you make your choice, here are 6 reasons for choosing the best entertainment, not the cheapest.

1. You get what you pay for.
Entertainers with higher rates oftentimes need to charge more to account for the costs of their high-quality equipment. Many performers set them based on their professional experience. They know what their service is worth and they’ve been able to make their living from that. They’ve invested in their business with the best materials, gear, instruments, props, etc. to give their clients most immersive experience. These materials can make a huge difference between one vendor and another.

Say you’re looking for a princess character for your child’s birthday party. To make a fairy tale come to life, performers need costumes and accessories that not only look pretty and authentic but also hold up to wear and tear. Along with the costs of dry cleaning, well-made costumes are a large investment for professional princess characters. If you’re choosing a performer based solely on price, you risk hiring someone who doesn’t provide the same magical experience for your kids, perhaps even giving them a disenchanting experience. A top-notch entertainer will deliver a performance that you and your family will remember for years to come.

To make a fairy tale come to life, performers need costumes and accessories that not only look pretty and authentic but also hold up to wear and tear. Along with the costs of dry cleaning, well-made costumes are a large investment for professional princess characters. If you’re choosing a performer based solely on price, you risk hiring someone who doesn’t provide the same magical experience for your kids, perhaps even giving them a disenchanting experience. A top-notch entertainer will deliver a performance that you and your family will remember for years to come.

 


 

Don’t let the sticker shock of good entertainment throw off your plans. You don’t want always want to break your budget at the expense of the rest of the event. Simply determine your priorities and set the spending from there. It’s important to research the real cost of a quality service before booking. If there is a significant drop-off between bids, then you can probably expect a drop-off in quality as well. Adjust your budget to your talent and quality expectations.

2. Professionals who are invested in their business are also invested in their clients.
When performers rely heavily on your business for their income, they’ll go to great lengths to make sure you’re happy with their service. Most of our GigSalad entertainers are self-employed, independent business people. They depend on good reviews and word of mouth for promotion and buzz.

Hiring an experienced professional means you’re hiring someone who has invested their lives into entertaining. Their goal is to make a living and provide you with a memorable event at the same time. Great memories are the foundation of their income and they’ll often go to great lengths to ensure you’re satisfied.

3. Pros know how to customize for your needs.
Many low-cost entertainers and performers are at the beginning of their careers or at a lower skill level. Often, this means that they offer a limited repertoire and fewer options as they are developing their craft. Your event is unique to you, therefore, you’ll need someone who can customize their act or services to your event. A good sign of a professional is their ability and willingness to reasonably adapt to your event needs.

4. Pros offer more than just entertainment. They give you peace of mind.
Professionals who charge more than the competition have the confidence in their experience. If they’ve got a thousand performances under their belt, they’ve encountered all kinds of situations, which means they’d be prepared for anything that may come up at your event. The ability to adapt and improvise is especially beneficial in unexpected situations that put your event at risk of turning into a disaster!


5. The difference in cost makes all the difference in the success of your event.
You’ve decided to take the risk and hire an entertainer for your event. Perhaps a strolling magician for the office party you were picked to plan. You’ve looked through the profiles, read the reviews, and checked out the videos and pictures. When the moment of decision comes, the temptation of saving a few bucks by hiring someone with fewer reviews and a lower quality presentation get very real very quickly. That’s money that could go to streamers! But those few dollars could mean the difference in the quality of your event and the likelihood of using entertainment again. A great professional turns the groans of “Remember last year? I hope that doesn’t happen again,” to the excitement of “Remember last year? I can’t wait to see what happens this time!” Paying a few extra bucks can prevent the dreaded buyer’s remorse.

6. There are no do-overs.
GigSalad’s mission is to help you Book Something Awesome. We recognize that many of the events we connect entertainers with are often once in a lifetime moments. That significance is one of the reasons we encourage you to take the time and research your providers well. You may not get a chance to do it again. We hope that you would take the few extra minutes necessary to thoroughly read the bids, examine the profiles, view the media, and make an educated decision. Don’t risk devaluing a critical life moment or celebration by going bargain hunting. If the price is right and the quality is high, invest in the memory.  

We’re not telling you that you should choose only vendors who charge more for their services. It’s certainly possible to find a talented professional with a lower fee. We’re simply encouraging you to do your homework. Look at their photos and videos, read reviews, ask them questions. Figure out why their rates are what they are.

Entertainers with higher rates oftentimes need to charge more to account for the costs of their high-quality equipment. Many performers set them based on their professional experience. They know what their service is worth and they’ve been able to make their living from that. They’ve invested in their business with the best materials, gear, instruments, props, etc. to give their clients most immersive experience. These materials can make a huge difference between one vendor and another.

Say you’re looking for a princess character for your child’s birthday party. To make a fairy tale come to life, performers need costumes and accessories that not only look pretty and authentic but also hold up to wear and tear. Along with the costs of dry cleaning, well-made costumes are a large investment for professional princess characters. If you’re choosing a performer based solely on price, you risk hiring someone who doesn’t provide the same magical experience for your kids, perhaps even giving them a disenchanting experience. A top-notch entertainer will deliver a performance that you and your family will remember for years to come.

 


 

Don’t let the sticker shock of good entertainment throw off your plans. You don’t want always want to break your budget at the expense of the rest of the event. Simply determine your priorities and set the spending from there. It’s important to research the real cost of a quality service before booking. If there is a significant drop-off between bids, then you can probably expect a drop-off in quality as well. Adjust your budget to your talent and quality expectations.

2. Professionals who are invested in their business are also invested in their clients.
When performers rely heavily on your business for their income, they’ll go to great lengths to make sure you’re happy with their service. Most of our GigSalad entertainers are self-employed, independent business people. They depend on good reviews and word of mouth for promotion and buzz.

Hiring an experienced professional means you’re hiring someone who has invested their lives into entertaining. Their goal is to make a living and provide you with a memorable event at the same time. Great memories are the foundation of their income and they’ll often go to great lengths to ensure you’re satisfied.

3. Pros know how to customize for your needs.
Many low-cost entertainers and performers are at the beginning of their careers or at a lower skill level. Often, this means that they offer a limited repertoire and fewer options as they are developing their craft. Your event is unique to you, therefore, you’ll need someone who can customize their act or services to your event. A good sign of a professional is their ability and willingness to reasonably adapt to your event needs.

4. Pros offer more than just entertainment. They give you peace of mind.
Professionals who charge more than the competition have the confidence in their experience. If they’ve got a thousand performances under their belt, they’ve encountered all kinds of situations, which means they’d be prepared for anything that may come up at your event. The ability to adapt and improvise is especially beneficial in unexpected situations that put your event at risk of turning into a disaster!


5. The difference in cost makes all the difference in the success of your event.
You’ve decided to take the risk and hire an entertainer for your event. Perhaps a strolling magician for the office party you were picked to plan. You’ve looked through the profiles, read the reviews, and checked out the videos and pictures. When the moment of decision comes, the temptation of saving a few bucks by hiring someone with fewer reviews and a lower quality presentation get very real very quickly. That’s money that could go to streamers! But those few dollars could mean the difference in the quality of your event and the likelihood of using entertainment again. A great professional turns the groans of “Remember last year? I hope that doesn’t happen again,” to the excitement of “Remember last year? I can’t wait to see what happens this time!” Paying a few extra bucks can prevent the dreaded buyer’s remorse.

6. There are no do-overs.
GigSalad’s mission is to help you Book Something Awesome. We recognize that many of the events we connect entertainers with are often once in a lifetime moments.

We hope that you would take the few extra minutes necessary to thoroughly read the bids, examine the profiles, view the media, and make an educated decision. Don’t risk devaluing a critical life moment or celebration by going bargain hunting. If the price is right and the quality is high, invest in the memory.  

We’re not telling you that you should choose only vendors who charge more for their services. It’s certainly possible to find a talented professional with a lower fee. We’re simply encouraging you to do your homework. Look at their photos and videos, read reviews, ask them questions. Figure out why their rates are what they are.

On GigSalad, we deliver more than 600 categories of entertainment and event services for the ability to compare rates of various performers. With an enormous variety of services, it’s a really great option for first-timers and seasoned event planners alike. But with so many talented professionals out there, how do you choose? Budget may be a large factor in who you choose to book, but before you make your choice, here are 6 reasons for choosing the best entertainment, not the cheapest.

1. You get what you pay for.
Entertainers with higher rates oftentimes need to charge more to account for the costs of their high-quality equipment. Many performers set them based on their professional experience. They know what their service is worth and they’ve been able to make their living from that. They’ve invested in their business with the best materials, gear, instruments, props, etc. to give their clients most immersive experience. These materials can make a huge difference between one vendor and another.

Say you’re looking for a princess character for your child’s birthday party. To make a fairy tale come to life, performers need costumes and accessories that not only look pretty and authentic but also hold up to wear and tear. Along with the costs of dry cleaning, well-made costumes are a large investment for professional princess characters. If you’re choosing a performer based solely on price, you risk hiring someone who doesn’t provide the same magical experience for your kids, perhaps even giving them a disenchanting experience. A top-notch entertainer will deliver a performance that you and your family will remember for years to come.

 


 

Don’t let the sticker shock of good entertainment throw off your plans. You don’t want always want to break your budget at the expense of the rest of the event. Simply determine your priorities and set the spending from there. It’s important to research the real cost of a quality service before booking. If there is a significant drop-off between bids, then you can probably expect a drop-off in quality as well. Adjust your budget to your talent and quality expectations.

2. Professionals who are invested in their business are also invested in their clients.
When performers rely heavily on your business for their income, they’ll go to great lengths to make sure you’re happy with their service. Most of our GigSalad entertainers are self-employed, independent business people. They depend on good reviews and word of mouth for promotion and buzz.

Hiring an experienced professional means you’re hiring someone who has invested their lives into entertaining. Their goal is to make a living and provide you with a memorable event at the same time. Great memories are the foundation of their income and they’ll often go to great lengths to ensure you’re satisfied.

3. Pros know how to customize for your needs.
Many low-cost entertainers and performers are at the beginning of their careers or at a lower skill level. Often, this means that they offer a limited repertoire and fewer options as they are developing their craft. Your event is unique to you, therefore, you’ll need someone who can customize their act or services to your event. A good sign of a professional is their ability and willingness to reasonably adapt to your event needs.

4. Pros offer more than just entertainment. They give you peace of mind.
Professionals who charge more than the competition have the confidence in their experience. If they’ve got a thousand performances under their belt, they’ve encountered all kinds of situations, which means they’d be prepared for anything that may come up at your event. The ability to adapt and improvise is especially beneficial in unexpected situations that put your event at risk of turning into a disaster!


5. The difference in cost makes all the difference in the success of your event.
You’ve decided to take the risk and hire an entertainer for your event. Perhaps a strolling magician for the office party you were picked to plan. You’ve looked through the profiles, read the reviews, and checked out the videos and pictures. When the moment of decision comes, the temptation of saving a few bucks by hiring someone with fewer reviews and a lower quality presentation get very real very quickly. That’s money that could go to streamers! But those few dollars could mean the difference in the quality of your event and the likelihood of using entertainment again. A great professional turns the groans of “Remember last year? I hope that doesn’t happen again,” to the excitement of “Remember last year? I can’t wait to see what happens this time!” Paying a few extra bucks can prevent the dreaded buyer’s remorse.

6. There are no do-overs.
GigSalad’s mission is to help you Book Something Awesome. We recognize that many of the events we connect entertainers with are often once in a lifetime moments. That significance is one of the reasons we encourage you to take the time and research your providers well. You may not get a chance to do it again. We hope that you would take the few extra minutes necessary to thoroughly read the bids, examine the profiles, view the media, and make an educated decision. Don’t risk devaluing a critical life moment or celebration by going bargain hunting. If the price is right and the quality is high, invest in the memory.  

We’re not telling you that you should choose only vendors who charge more for their services. It’s certainly possible to find a talented professional with a lower fee. We’re simply encouraging you to do your homework. Look at their photos and videos, read reviews, ask them questions. Figure out why their rates are what they are. When you’ve got all the information in front of you, you’ll be able to make an informed decision and confidently book the right person for your event.",v2,0.34502981707461894

Consumers want more choices, but all those choices can be daunting. It gives the consumer the responsibility of educating themselves on the best option for their circumstances. On GigSalad, we deliver more than 600 categories of entertainment and event services for the ability to compare rates of various performers. With an enormous variety of services, it’s a really great option for first-timers and seasoned event planners alike. But with so many talented professionals out there, how do you choose? Budget may be a large factor in who you choose to book, but before you make your choice, here are 6 reasons for choosing the best entertainment, not the cheapest.

1. You get what you pay for.
Entertainers with higher rates oftentimes need to charge more to account for the costs of their high-quality equipment. Many performers set them based on their professional experience. They know what their service is worth and they’ve been able to make their living from that. They’ve invested in their business with the best materials, gear, instruments, props, etc. to give their clients most immersive experience. These materials can make a huge difference between one vendor and another.

Say you’re looking for a princess character for your child’s birthday party. To make a fairy tale come to life, performers need costumes and accessories that not only look pretty and authentic but also hold up to wear and tear. Along with the costs of dry cleaning, well-made costumes are a large investment for professional princess characters. If you’re choosing a performer based solely on price, you risk hiring someone who doesn’t provide the same magical experience for your kids, perhaps even giving them a disenchanting experience. A top-notch entertainer will deliver a performance that you and your family will remember for years to come.

 


 

Don’t let the sticker shock of good entertainment throw off your plans. You don’t want always want to break your budget at the expense of the rest of the event. Simply determine your priorities and set the spending from there. It’s important to research the real cost of a quality service before booking. If there is a significant drop-off between bids, then you can probably expect a drop-off in quality as well. Adjust your budget to your talent and quality expectations.

2. Professionals who are invested in their business are also invested in their clients.
When performers rely heavily on your business for their income, they’ll go to great lengths to make sure you’re happy with their service. Most of our GigSalad entertainers are self-employed, independent business people. They depend on good reviews and word of mouth for promotion and buzz.

Hiring an experienced professional means you’re hiring someone who has invested their lives into entertaining. Their goal is to make a living and provide you with a memorable event at the same time. Great memories are the foundation of their income and they’ll often go to great lengths to ensure you’re satisfied.

3. Pros know how to customize for your needs.
Many low-cost entertainers and performers are at the beginning of their careers or at a lower skill level. Often, this means that they offer a limited repertoire and fewer options as they are developing their craft. Your event is unique to you, therefore, you’ll need someone who can customize their act or services to your event. A good sign of a professional is their ability and willingness to reasonably adapt to your event needs.

4. Pros offer more than just entertainment. They give you peace of mind.
Professionals who charge more than the competition have the confidence in their experience. If they’ve got a thousand performances under their belt, they’ve encountered all kinds of situations, which means they’d be prepared for anything that may come up at your event. The ability to adapt and improvise is especially beneficial in unexpected situations that put your event at risk of turning into a disaster!


5. The difference in cost makes all the difference in the success of your event.
You’ve decided to take the risk and hire an entertainer for your event. Perhaps a strolling magician for the office party you were picked to plan. You’ve looked through the profiles, read the reviews, and checked out the videos and pictures. When the moment of decision comes, the temptation of saving a few bucks by hiring someone with fewer reviews and a lower quality presentation get very real very quickly. That’s money that could go to streamers! But those few dollars could mean the difference in the quality of your event and the likelihood of using entertainment again. A great professional turns the groans of “Remember last year? I hope that doesn’t happen again,” to the excitement of “Remember last year? I can’t wait to see what happens this time!” Paying a few extra bucks can prevent the dreaded buyer’s remorse.

6. There are no do-overs.
GigSalad’s mission is to help you Book Something Awesome. We recognize that many of the events we connect entertainers with are often once in a lifetime moments. That significance is one of the reasons we encourage you to take the time and research your providers well. You may not get a chance to do it again. We hope that you would take the few extra minutes necessary to thoroughly read the bids, examine the profiles, view the media, and make an educated decision. Don’t risk devaluing a critical life moment or celebration by going bargain hunting. If the price is right and the quality is high, invest in the memory.

Don’t risk devaluing a critical life moment or celebration by going bargain hunting. If the price is right and the quality is high, invest in the memory.  

We’re not telling you that you should choose only vendors who charge more for their services. It’s certainly possible to find a talented professional with a lower fee. We’re simply encouraging you to do your homework. Look at their photos and videos, read reviews, ask them questions. Figure out why their rates are what they are.

Consumers want more choices, but all those choices can be daunting. It gives the consumer the responsibility of educating themselves on the best option for their circumstances. On GigSalad, we deliver more than 600 categories of entertainment and event services for the ability to compare rates of various performers. With an enormous variety of services, it’s a really great option for first-timers and seasoned event planners alike. But with so many talented professionals out there, how do you choose? Budget may be a large factor in who you choose to book, but before you make your choice, here are 6 reasons for choosing the best entertainment, not the cheapest.

1. You get what you pay for.
Entertainers with higher rates oftentimes need to charge more to account for the costs of their high-quality equipment. Many performers set them based on their professional experience. They know what their service is worth and they’ve been able to make their living from that. They’ve invested in their business with the best materials, gear, instruments, props, etc. to give their clients most immersive experience. These materials can make a huge difference between one vendor and another.

Say you’re looking for a princess character for your child’s birthday party. To make a fairy tale come to life, performers need costumes and accessories that not only look pretty and authentic but also hold up to wear and tear. Along with the costs of dry cleaning, well-made costumes are a large investment for professional princess characters. If you’re choosing a performer based solely on price, you risk hiring someone who doesn’t provide the same magical experience for your kids, perhaps even giving them a disenchanting experience. A top-notch entertainer will deliver a performance that you and your family will remember for years to come.

 


 

Don’t let the sticker shock of good entertainment throw off your plans. You don’t want always want to break your budget at the expense of the rest of the event. Simply determine your priorities and set the spending from there. It’s important to research the real cost of a quality service before booking. If there is a significant drop-off between bids, then you can probably expect a drop-off in quality as well. Adjust your budget to your talent and quality expectations.

2. Professionals who are invested in their business are also invested in their clients.
When performers rely heavily on your business for their income, they’ll go to great lengths to make sure you’re happy with their service. Most of our GigSalad entertainers are self-employed, independent business people. They depend on good reviews and word of mouth for promotion and buzz.

Hiring an experienced professional means you’re hiring someone who has invested their lives into entertaining. Their goal is to make a living and provide you with a memorable event at the same time. Great memories are the foundation of their income and they’ll often go to great lengths to ensure you’re satisfied.

3. Pros know how to customize for your needs.
Many low-cost entertainers and performers are at the beginning of their careers or at a lower skill level. Often, this means that they offer a limited repertoire and fewer options as they are developing their craft. Your event is unique to you, therefore, you’ll need someone who can customize their act or services to your event. A good sign of a professional is their ability and willingness to reasonably adapt to your event needs.

4. Pros offer more than just entertainment. They give you peace of mind.
Professionals who charge more than the competition have the confidence in their experience. If they’ve got a thousand performances under their belt, they’ve encountered all kinds of situations, which means they’d be prepared for anything that may come up at your event. The ability to adapt and improvise is especially beneficial in unexpected situations that put your event at risk of turning into a disaster!


5. The difference in cost makes all the difference in the success of your event.
You’ve decided to take the risk and hire an entertainer for your event. Perhaps a strolling magician for the office party you were picked to plan. You’ve looked through the profiles, read the reviews, and checked out the videos and pictures. When the moment of decision comes, the temptation of saving a few bucks by hiring someone with fewer reviews and a lower quality presentation get very real very quickly. That’s money that could go to streamers! But those few dollars could mean the difference in the quality of your event and the likelihood of using entertainment again. A great professional turns the groans of “Remember last year? I hope that doesn’t happen again,” to the excitement of “Remember last year? I can’t wait to see what happens this time!” Paying a few extra bucks can prevent the dreaded buyer’s remorse.

6. There are no do-overs.

A great professional turns the groans of “Remember last year? I hope that doesn’t happen again,” to the excitement of “Remember last year? I can’t wait to see what happens this time!” Paying a few extra bucks can prevent the dreaded buyer’s remorse.

6. There are no do-overs.
GigSalad’s mission is to help you Book Something Awesome. We recognize that many of the events we connect entertainers with are often once in a lifetime moments. That significance is one of the reasons we encourage you to take the time and research your providers well. You may not get a chance to do it again. We hope that you would take the few extra minutes necessary to thoroughly read the bids, examine the profiles, view the media, and make an educated decision. Don’t risk devaluing a critical life moment or celebration by going bargain hunting. If the price is right and the quality is high, invest in the memory.  

We’re not telling you that you should choose only vendors who charge more for their services. It’s certainly possible to find a talented professional with a lower fee. We’re simply encouraging you to do your homework. Look at their photos and videos, read reviews, ask them questions. Figure out why their rates are what they are. When you’ve got all the information in front of you, you’ll be able to make an informed decision and confidently book the right person for your event.",base,0.49444415093598276

Consumers want more choices, but all those choices can be daunting. It gives the consumer the responsibility of educating themselves on the best option for their circumstances. On GigSalad, we deliver more than 600 categories of entertainment and event services for the ability to compare rates of various performers. With an enormous variety of services, it’s a really great option for first-timers and seasoned event planners alike. But with so many talented professionals out there, how do you choose? Budget may be a large factor in who you choose to book, but before you make your choice, here are 6 reasons for choosing the best entertainment, not the cheapest.

1. You get what you pay for.
Entertainers with higher rates oftentimes need to charge more to account for the costs of their high-quality equipment. Many performers set them based on their professional experience. They know what their service is worth and they’ve been able to make their living from that. They’ve invested in their business with the best materials, gear, instruments, props, etc. to give their clients most immersive experience. These materials can make a huge difference between one vendor and another.

Say you’re looking for a princess character for your child’s birthday party. To make a fairy tale come to life, performers need costumes and accessories that not only look pretty and authentic but also hold up to wear and tear. Along with the costs of dry cleaning, well-made costumes are a large investment for professional princess characters. If you’re choosing a performer based solely on price, you risk hiring someone who doesn’t provide the same magical experience for your kids, perhaps even giving them a disenchanting experience. A top-notch entertainer will deliver a performance that you and your family will remember for years to come.

 


 

Don’t let the sticker shock of good entertainment throw off your plans. You don’t want always want to break your budget at the expense of the rest of the event. Simply determine your priorities and set the spending from there. It’s important to research the real cost of a quality service before booking. If there is a significant drop-off between bids, then you can probably expect a drop-off in quality as well. Adjust your budget to your talent and quality expectations.

2. Professionals who are invested in their business are also invested in their clients.
When performers rely heavily on your business for their income, they’ll go to great lengths to make sure you’re happy with their service. Most of our GigSalad entertainers are self-employed, independent business people. They depend on good reviews and word of mouth for promotion and buzz.

Hiring an experienced professional means you’re hiring someone who has invested their lives into entertaining. Their goal is to make a living and provide you with a memorable event at the same time. Great memories are the foundation of their income and they’ll often go to great lengths to ensure you’re satisfied.

3. Pros know how to customize for your needs.
Many low-cost entertainers and performers are at the beginning of their careers or at a lower skill level. Often, this means that they offer a limited repertoire and fewer options as they are developing their craft. Your event is unique to you, therefore, you’ll need someone who can customize their act or services to your event. A good sign of a professional is their ability and willingness to reasonably adapt to your event needs.

4. Pros offer more than just entertainment. They give you peace of mind.
Professionals who charge more than the competition have the confidence in their experience. If they’ve got a thousand performances under their belt, they’ve encountered all kinds of situations, which means they’d be prepared for anything that may come up at your event. The ability to adapt and improvise is especially beneficial in unexpected situations that put your event at risk of turning into a disaster!


5. The difference in cost makes all the difference in the success of your event.
You’ve decided to take the risk and hire an entertainer for your event. Perhaps a strolling magician for the office party you were picked to plan. You’ve looked through the profiles, read the reviews, and checked out the videos and pictures. When the moment of decision comes, the temptation of saving a few bucks by hiring someone with fewer reviews and a lower quality presentation get very real very quickly. That’s money that could go to streamers! But those few dollars could mean the difference in the quality of your event and the likelihood of using entertainment again.

"We've been working on improving `next export`

◆ App Router compatible
◆ Server Components compatible
◆ Route Handlers compatible
◆ Built-in to `next build`
◆ Ensures development matches static export

Shipped on canary, stable soon!

https://app-router-export.vercel.app

---

App Router compatible: 
Full static export when using the `app` directory.

All routes are opted in to `export const dynamic = 'error'` giving you early errors for e.g. calling `headers()` / `cookies()` as there is no server.

https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/segment-config#dynamic

---

Server Components compatible:
Server Component could already be rendered as static html for initial load and static payload for client navigation. There are no additional changes to make it work for output: export.

https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/static-and-dynamic-rendering#static-rendering-default

---

Route Handlers compatible:
Route handlers (route.js / route.ts) can be rendered to a static response at build time if you it only exports GET and doesn't read values from `request`.

Route handlers that use static rendering are supported in output: export.

---

Built-in to `next build`:
You no longer have to run `next export`. The output of `next build` will have the `out` directory.

`next export` has mostly been a copying operation, it copies the result from next build static rendering to the `out` directory. Now it's fully built-in.


---

Ensures development matches static export:
Since Next.js allows you to use both static and dynamic rendering next export had to warn/error when you used features that need a server, this led to finding out the application couldn't export later on.

output: export bridges this gap in functionality by giving you feedback during development that a certain feature can't be used when you want to build an application without dynamic rendering.

---

This is just the beginning, we're working on additional improvements for output: 'export'. e.g. improvements for images.

Prompt: I am developing a sign explaining river corridors. Write me one section of text explain over river corridors effect erosion that is about 40 words long.River corridors encompass an area around and adjacent to a river where fluvial erosion, or erosion caused by the movement of water, is most likely to occur [1]. This helps to manage the rivers towards a state of dynamic equilibrium. Understanding and managing the effects of erosion within river corridors is important for preserving the natural state and functioning of the river ecosystem.make this section a 3rd grade reaDING LEVELWater can cause the ground to wear away, which is called erosion. River corridors are areas near rivers where this happens a lot. It's important to know about erosion in these areas because it helps us take care of the rivers. [1]instead do a 5th grade reading levelRiver corridors are areas around rivers that are prone to erosion, which is when water wears away the ground. It's important to manage erosion in these areas to help keep the rivers healthy and in balance. [1]Incorporate the following words in the response Cliff formation, Sandbank formation fastest flow, erosion, slower flow River corridors are areas along rivers that are prone to erosion, which is when water wears away the ground. When water flows faster, it can cause erosion to happen more quickly, creating cliffs and sandbanks. On the other hand, when the water flows slower, there is less erosion. Understanding how erosion works in river corridors can help us manage the rivers and keep them healthy.

These corridors provide important habitat for many species, including birds, fish, and mammals. They also serve as corridors for wildlife to move between different areas, helping to maintain healthy populations and prevent isolation. In addition, riparian corridors can help to filter pollutants and improve water quality, which benefits both wildlife and humans. [2]",none,0.3763555098006998

She took us grandchildren back for homecoming most years, sometimes even had us pick cotton, reminding us, “You’ve got to know your history.” She also told us of the folks she knew in Pelham as a child, some of whom were born enslaved, a fact that horrified me. Clarice always refused my sympathies. “Child, don’t be believing what folks say about how bad slavery was,” she’d explain. “Everybody had a job, a place to stay and something to eat. Now if somebody came and paid your rent, you wouldn’t be sitting up talking about you wanna leave, would you?” This dumbfounded me, until I realized she was mostly joking. But there was something deeper in her response. I eventually learned more about the violence that met newly emancipated Black Texans. Ku Klux Klansmen, along with local officials and everyday citizens, terrorized freedmen at will and without repercussions. They burned churches and homes, intimidated those who sought employment, and worse. Gen. Joseph Jones Reynolds, a commander of the Department of Texas during Reconstruction, commented in 1868, “The murder of Negroes is so common as to render it impossible to keep an accurate account of them.” The Equal Justice Initiative has tried, reporting that more than 2,000 Black women, men and children were victims of racial terrorist lynchings during Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877. Slavery was awful, no doubt, but emancipation brought its own unique cruelties. Formerly enslaved Texans were forced to craft lives from less than scratch; choose new names; attempt to reunite with stolen partners, siblings, children. They faced daily threats of jail or worse because of the new Black codes that severely restricted their freedom — their freedom to work, but also their freedom to be unemployed or even to stand still for too long. The more I learned, the more I understood my grandmother’s perspective. She’d heard the testimonies of those who’d had to navigate both the tragedy of slavery and the terror of emancipation. She couldn’t let me underestimate the enormous price our people had paid to be free. I miss Clarice so much some days, it’s hard to think straight. I regret not asking more questions about our family, about her life in Pelham. As more folks in Clarice’s generation pass away, we are losing the final physical links to those who know our history — who are our history. We can do no better this Juneteenth than to spend time with the elders who are still with us. Get them to talk. Record their stories. These historical and systemic injustices have not been resolved. But as Black Americans, we cannot wait for the day when our country will pay the respect that is due our forebears — or pay us those reparations. Instead of holding our breath, let us find the freshest air we can find and breathe it as deeply as we can, with joy. Let us grieve for our forebears and feel deep gratitude as we think of the enormous price our people paid so we could be free. Let us remember that despite the degradation of slavery, they lived fully human lives, too. They laughed. They loved. They dreamed. They ate sweet treats. Let us pray to them and say, this year and always: Thank you."""""""" 

Argument 2: an excerpt from """"""""Juneteenth Reminds Us to Think About Economic Freedom, Not Just Legal Liberty"""""""" by Peter Coy: 

""""""""...[W]hen emancipation came, the first thing formerly enslaved people wanted was land, which they rightly saw as a prerequisite for real independence. “The way we can best take care of ourselves is to have land, and turn it and till it by our own labor,” a Baptist minister named Garrison Frazier told the secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, and the Union general William Sherman in a meeting in Savannah, Ga., in January 1865. Four days later Sherman famously promised 40 acres of land to each formerly enslaved family (the “and a mule” part came later). But the federal government never followed through on its promise of land — and thus true independence — to formerly enslaved people. Economics entered into the picture, Stanley said: If African Americans grew subsistence crops on their own plots, who would cultivate and harvest all the cotton, tobacco, sugar and rice grown on the vast plantations? After the Civil War, in lieu of land distribution, slavery was replaced by sharecropping, in which planters allowed tenant farmers to keep a portion of the crops they raised. That subjugated the tenants to the owners almost as surely as slavery did. At the same time, industrialization in the North meant that more and more white Americans were working for wages — about two-thirds by 1875, according to Stanley. Many drew the connection between themselves and African Americans. Eugene Debs, who led the Pullman railroad strike of 1894, said, “The paternalism of the Pullman is the same as the interest of a slaveholder in his human chattels. You are striking to avert slavery and degradation.” Today, the phrase “wage slavery” invoked by Debs and others has lost its punch. Many people who work for wages are doing very nicely, thank you. And many farmers and business owners, supposedly more independent, are buffeted by forces beyond their control, from bad weather to nasty customers. What hasn’t changed, 157 years after the Juneteenth proclamation, is that a majority of African Americans continue to lack wealth. The median wealth of Black families in 2019 was just $24,100, versus $142,500 for white families, according to a Federal Reserve survey. Something needs to change, but what? The nature of the economy has changed, and few people still think that the solution to inequality is to give people plots of land to farm. We are enmeshed economically with one another in ways that Jefferson could not have imagined. Instead of land grants, the new protections for workers are unionization, government regulation and profit-sharing, Stanley said. One can quibble over her formula, but the motivation behind it is unquestionable. Freedom — which must include economic freedom — is just as important now as it was on the original Juneteenth.""""

Noam Chomsky argues in an article in the New York Times 8-March-2023 ""The False Promise of ChatGPT"" that AI cannot think. 

Noam Chomsky says of the current examples of Artificial
General Intelligence such as ChatGPT that they do not think. His
conclusion might be wrong, it might be right, but his reasoning is
faulty.

Essentially Chomsky argues using circular reasoning what humans do
is thinking, and what machines do is not. His justification gives
exceptionalism a bad name!  He arrogantly defines all that humans do
as thinking and he denies that machines can think because they are
machines. That is what he says in his article again and again. And he
states this prejudice as his conclusion, as if he got there by reasoning.

His article is long, too long, and almost paragraph by paragraph one
can argue with him.  Let me tackle only this example of his:

        Here’s an example. Suppose you are holding an apple in your
        hand. Now you let the apple go. You observe the result and say,
        “The apple falls.” That is a description. A prediction
        might have been the statement “The apple will fall if I open
        my hand.” Both are valuable, and both can be correct. But an
        explanation is something more: It includes not only descriptions
        and predictions but also counterfactual conjectures like “Any
        such object would fall,” plus the additional clause “because
        of the force of gravity” or “because of the curvature of
        space-time” or whatever. That is a causal explanation: “The
        apple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity.”
        That is thinking.

Yes, that is thinking. Chomsky thinks here he is telling us what only
humans do. Task by task
he describes a human ability and then he says, ""That is thinking.""
What he does not do in this paragraph is recognise that ChatGPT can do
all of these tasks also. If Chomsky concludes ""that is thinking"" then
that must be evidence of thinking for anything which can do those tasks.
According to Chomsky's own argument ChatGPT can think.

What all (but a tiny handful of humans) are doing when they say “The
apple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity” is precisely
what ChatGPT is doing when it too says the same, and it does say the
same. Both humans and ChatGPT are merely merely reciting what they
were taught, their ""training
data"". Neither 99%-of-humans nor ChatGPT understand what is going on.

Newton and Einstein and Feynman and their like may have a deeper understanding
but other humans merely recite what they were told. Apples fall because
of gravity. And ChatGPT knows this in the same way as humans, it's
in the training data of humans and AI.  Humans do not work this out,
they recite a fact. So does ChatGPT.

ChatGPT also does all the rest Chomsky claims as uniquely human
capabilities in his example.  ChatGPT can do the description of the
apple falling and the prediction that it will fall. It can do what Chomsky
unnecessarily uses technical language for, it can do the ""counterfactual
conjecture"", it knows that all objects fall!  ChatGPT knows this is
“because of the curvature of space-time”.  ChatGPT knows this
""causal explanation"" better than most humans. ChatGPT knows “The
apple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity.” Yes,
and here I agree with Noam Chomsky: He says of the ""causal
explanation"" that ""That is thinking.""

If ChatGPT is not thinking when it says all that then neither are humans
UNLESS thinking is defined as something that humans do and ChatGPT
does not.  The only way Chomsky can support his assertion is by defining
""thinking"" and ""knowing"" and ""description"" and ""prediction"" and ""generalising""
etc etc as being that which are uniquely human capabilities.  Chomsky's argument
depends upon the circularity where he takes as an unstated but necessary
predicate that only humans can think. He concludes, after many paragraphs
of delusional obfuscation that thinking is what only humans can do.

Now, Chomsky is a great man and he may be right. But he doesn't show
this in his article.

        Here’s an example. Suppose you are holding an apple in your
        hand. Now you let the apple go. You observe the result and say,
        “The apple falls.” That is a description. A prediction
        might have been the statement “The apple will fall if I open
        my hand.” Both are valuable, and both can be correct. But an
        explanation is something more: It includes not only descriptions
        and predictions but also counterfactual conjectures like “Any
        such object would fall,” plus the additional clause “because
        of the force of gravity” or “because of the curvature of
        space-time” or whatever. That is a causal explanation: “The
        apple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity.”
        That is thinking.

Yes, that is thinking. Chomsky thinks here he is telling us what only
humans do. Task by task
he describes a human ability and then he says, ""That is thinking.""
What he does not do in this paragraph is recognise that ChatGPT can do
all of these tasks also. If Chomsky concludes ""that is thinking"" then
that must be evidence of thinking for anything which can do those tasks.
According to Chomsky's own argument ChatGPT can think.

What all (but a tiny handful of humans) are doing when they say “The
apple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity” is precisely
what ChatGPT is doing when it too says the same, and it does say the
same. Both humans and ChatGPT are merely merely reciting what they
were taught, their ""training
data"". Neither 99%-of-humans nor ChatGPT understand what is going on.

Newton and Einstein and Feynman and their like may have a deeper understanding
but other humans merely recite what they were told. Apples fall because
of gravity. And ChatGPT knows this in the same way as humans, it's
in the training data of humans and AI.  Humans do not work this out,
they recite a fact. So does ChatGPT.

ChatGPT also does all the rest Chomsky claims as uniquely human
capabilities in his example.  ChatGPT can do the description of the
apple falling and the prediction that it will fall. It can do what Chomsky
unnecessarily uses technical language for, it can do the ""counterfactual
conjecture"", it knows that all objects fall!  ChatGPT knows this is
“because of the curvature of space-time”.  ChatGPT knows this
""causal explanation"" better than most humans. ChatGPT knows “The
apple would not have fallen but for the force of gravity.” Yes,
and here I agree with Noam Chomsky: He says of the ""causal
explanation"" that ""That is thinking.""

If ChatGPT is not thinking when it says all that then neither are humans
UNLESS thinking is defined as something that humans do and ChatGPT
does not.  The only way Chomsky can support his assertion is by defining
""thinking"" and ""knowing"" and ""description"" and ""prediction"" and ""generalising""
etc etc as being that which are uniquely human capabilities.  Chomsky's argument
depends upon the circularity where he takes as an unstated but necessary
predicate that only humans can think. He concludes, after many paragraphs
of delusional obfuscation that thinking is what only humans can do.

Now, Chomsky is a great man and he may be right. But he doesn't show
this in his article.

"You are an AI system that has been trained to analyze the blow text for style, voice, and tone then use NLP to create a VoiceParagraph. A VoiceParagraph prompts a future AI system to write in the same style, voice, and tone. Here is the input text: I smacked my hand down on the hotel bar. The white marble was cool, which was very nice, since I was getting hot.
""A list of steps isn't helpful if you're facing the wrong way!""
I'd been talking with a couple fellow marketing speakers at an event, and we were joking about the industry's obsession with ""practical steps"" -- and how, whenever the word ""practical"" arises (like, when speakers are asked to be practical), it's implied that a list of steps will follow. It's as if, to marketers, the lone type of practical information is stepular. (Note that ""stepular"" is not a word but maybe should be.)
My friends and I agreed there are tons of other ways to impart practical advice. After all, anything practical affects your practice. That's why it's practical. (Aren't words fun?) Practical doesn't mean ""I can follow this without turning on my brain.""
For instance, big ideas that shift our perspectives help us take ANY step, better. Those big ideas are very practical.
Feeling inspired or confident when we go to work affects our practice in profound ways too. Inspiration and confidence-boosters are very practical.
Knowing WHY things work is even more powerful than knowing a list of WHAT works, kinda like knowing how to navigate with a compass is more powerful than knowing how to follow directions someone drew for you on a map. Knowing WHY things work is very, very practical.
You get it. I'm passionate about this.
And so, motivated by 16 years in marketing -- and a generous pour of bourbon from the hotel bartender -- I smacked my hand on that cold marble and delivered my hot take:
""A list of steps isn't helpful if you're facing the wrong way!""
Smack.
Swig.
Smile.
(Hey, I know a good line when I say it. I wasn't entirely unhappy.)
A list of steps isn't helpful if you're facing the wrong way.
	•	If you're on the wrong path, you don't need ""next steps."" You need a pivot. Maybe even a three-quarter pirouette. But definitely don't move forward.
	•	If you aren't saying anything of value, where you say it (the channel) is irrelevant.
	•	If you have the wrong strategy (or none at all), the tactics don't yet matter. Should you launch a podcast or a newsletter? I don't know, but I'm pretty sure carpenters don't sit around saying, ""Should I use a hammer?"" I mean ... what are you trying to build?
If success were about finding and following the right steps, success would be a cinch. But that's not reality.
As a result, more often than we realize, we don't need more stepful prescriptions. (Note that ""stepful"" is not a word but maybe should be.) Instead, we need more thoughtful approaches. We need the posture, the confidence, the clarity, the vision. We need better ideas, smarter strategies, and a whole heck of a lot more curiosity.
We need to face the right way.
This brings me to the idea of ""story"" and how it's typically taught and understood. Typically, we end up facing the wrong way, marching down a path that isn't actually where we need to go. I'd sum up this issue like this:
Most advice about storytelling would have us understand story, when really, we need to understand how to be storytellers.
These are not the same things, and our divergence from the real goal (be storytellers) begins with three common misconceptions. Or if you're a fan of beating a metaphor to death (and hoo-baby, am I ever!), then this is the stuff that causes us to face the wrong direction and head down the wrong paths.
Misconception #1: Stories are special.
Very commonly, the way story is taught or positioned causes us to place it up on a pedestal, like some supernatural power we can deploy to have more impact or see greater results. And look, I get it. I feel a reverence for incredible stories and refreshing creativity. I can stare towards the horizon and fill my lungs with the sweet, sweet air of possibility too. Some stories ARE special.
But then, yanno ... most of them aren't. Most of them should just be regular old communication. But if we see them as special, then inevitably, we start to use them ONLY on special occasions.
	•	The monthly all-hands meeting.
	•	The company home page.
	•	The oft-promoted case study.
	•	The new podcast trailer.
	•	The big, important essay.
	•	The opening moments of a keynote.
That's the problem. This is not how to become a storyteller. This is how to, occasionally, tell a story.
Stories aren't for special occasions. Stories are just for ... occasions. Everywhere. All the time. Tell stories. You'll serve others better and so will be better served.
	•	When you start to face the path labeled ""Stories are special,"" remember to face a different way. Let's label that path ""Story Everywhere.""
Misconception #2: Stories are abstract.
Something that is ""abstract"" is something that is considered separate from you or the things you already know or consider tangible.
That's how we view this notion of ""story"" too. I get asked all the time on podcast interviews (he writes, understanding just how cringey and self-aggrandizing that may have sounded):
""So Jay, what are the benefits of story? Who should rely on story? How do we measure story?""
What, um ... what the actual hell are we talking about?
To me, that's like asking, ""What are the benefits of emotions? Should we use emotions?""
YES! That's just how we communicate. But just as marketers view ""emotions"" as only these extreme things (nope, they're implied or overtly communicated literally everywhere), marketers view ""story"" as these abstract things. It's all very much OUT THERE.
EMOTIONS!
STORY!
(Trumpets blare. Drums beat. Analytics go up-and-to-the-right.)
Abstract: existing in thought or as an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence.
The solution to this misconception? Prioritize existence. Let's make this more concrete, shall we?
	•	You experienced some stuff. Describe it.
	•	You felt some things while experiencing some stuff. Describe that too.
You have an idea. You ship the idea. It's concrete now. It exists.
Prioritize existence. Forget the abstractions.
The reason we don't do this more often is simple: the internet. (Ever heard of it?) It's both a gift and a curse to our creative causes. Let me explain...
Creative people understand the work in two phases across their lives: before and after we see ""the code of the Matrix."" In other words, our first attempts at anything are driven by gut feel. We only really sense the whole. It's only later that we start to notice the tiny parts, pieces, techniques, and frameworks that make up the whole -- which then unleashes a whole new level of creativity, as we are in greater control of the craft. It's like Neo from The Matrix movie, before and after he sees the code. When he does see it, he becomes a superhero, doing things others only wish they could do.
The internet has put much more of the ""code"" of the creative ""Matrix"" on full ""display."" (Quotes added because lists of two make me uncomfortable.) We can instantly access knowledge about the tiny parts, pieces, techniques, and frameworks immediately, everywhere, and for free. That level of access is great!
Also?
That level of access is intimidating!
Because we can see or hear others talking about all kinds of techniques and heuristics and philosophies and ups-and-downs to their work, we often get lost in it. Sometimes, it feels productive to consume this stuff. Meanwhile, we haven't produced anything. Other times, it doesn't feel productive; it feels horrifying. We think we MUST understand story structure and open loops and hooks and all these parts and pieces in order to become a worthy storyteller.
Poppycock.
That way of thinking is cock of the poppy.
(Don't be offended. ""Poppycock"" is from the Dutch word pappekak, meaning ""soft dung."" Oh, and speaking of words and creatures who poop a lot...)
Imagine if we tried to learn to speak like we try to learn storytelling. Imagine if, as little kids, we were told we had understand how to spell every word we'd say + the grammatical rules + the origins of the words + how to write them in straight lines and beautiful scripts ... all before we could speak them out loud.
We would never utter a word.
But what do we actually do? We just... start... speaking. We hear words, then we mimic them.
You've heard stories. So just... start... telling them.
If and when you get stuck, no problem. You can find a key to that door rather easily thanks to allllll that easily accessible information. But you don't need it to start or even elevate your work! You can simply start, learn, and keep going. All that advice should serve YOU, but way too often, it feels like we're trying to serve it. Don't try to find clarity to justify creating. Create to find clarity.
It's in the practice itself that we find our confidence, our personal techniques, our unique styles, and more. It's in the practice that we find ourselves. In waiting to practice until we learn the abstractions, we just end up removing ourselves. We arrive to the work full of everyone else's ideas for what we “have to do,” rather than listening to intuition.
If you want to feel confident or find clarity, just start making things. Tell stories. Then do it again. And again. And again.
The best way to find a groove is to start grooving.

It's in the practice itself that we find our confidence, our personal techniques, our unique styles, and more. It's in the practice that we find ourselves. In waiting to practice until we learn the abstractions, we just end up removing ourselves. We arrive to the work full of everyone else's ideas for what we “have to do,” rather than listening to intuition.
If you want to feel confident or find clarity, just start making things. Tell stories. Then do it again. And again. And again.
The best way to find a groove is to start grooving.

"You are an AI system that has been trained to analyze the blow text for style, voice, and tone then use NLP to create a VoiceParagraph. A VoiceParagraph prompts a future AI system to write in the same style, voice, and tone. Here is the input text: I smacked my hand down on the hotel bar. The white marble was cool, which was very nice, since I was getting hot.
""A list of steps isn't helpful if you're facing the wrong way!""
I'd been talking with a couple fellow marketing speakers at an event, and we were joking about the industry's obsession with ""practical steps"" -- and how, whenever the word ""practical"" arises (like, when speakers are asked to be practical), it's implied that a list of steps will follow. It's as if, to marketers, the lone type of practical information is stepular. (Note that ""stepular"" is not a word but maybe should be.)
My friends and I agreed there are tons of other ways to impart practical advice. After all, anything practical affects your practice. That's why it's practical. (Aren't words fun?) Practical doesn't mean ""I can follow this without turning on my brain.""
For instance, big ideas that shift our perspectives help us take ANY step, better. Those big ideas are very practical.
Feeling inspired or confident when we go to work affects our practice in profound ways too. Inspiration and confidence-boosters are very practical.
Knowing WHY things work is even more powerful than knowing a list of WHAT works, kinda like knowing how to navigate with a compass is more powerful than knowing how to follow directions someone drew for you on a map. Knowing WHY things work is very, very practical.
You get it. I'm passionate about this.
And so, motivated by 16 years in marketing -- and a generous pour of bourbon from the hotel bartender -- I smacked my hand on that cold marble and delivered my hot take:
""A list of steps isn't helpful if you're facing the wrong way!""
Smack.
Swig.
Smile.
(Hey, I know a good line when I say it. I wasn't entirely unhappy.)
A list of steps isn't helpful if you're facing the wrong way.
	•	If you're on the wrong path, you don't need ""next steps."" You need a pivot. Maybe even a three-quarter pirouette. But definitely don't move forward.
	•	If you aren't saying anything of value, where you say it (the channel) is irrelevant.
	•	If you have the wrong strategy (or none at all), the tactics don't yet matter. Should you launch a podcast or a newsletter? I don't know, but I'm pretty sure carpenters don't sit around saying, ""Should I use a hammer?"" I mean ... what are you trying to build?
If success were about finding and following the right steps, success would be a cinch. But that's not reality.
As a result, more often than we realize, we don't need more stepful prescriptions. (Note that ""stepful"" is not a word but maybe should be.) Instead, we need more thoughtful approaches. We need the posture, the confidence, the clarity, the vision. We need better ideas, smarter strategies, and a whole heck of a lot more curiosity.
We need to face the right way.
This brings me to the idea of ""story"" and how it's typically taught and understood. Typically, we end up facing the wrong way, marching down a path that isn't actually where we need to go. I'd sum up this issue like this:
Most advice about storytelling would have us understand story, when really, we need to understand how to be storytellers.
These are not the same things, and our divergence from the real goal (be storytellers) begins with three common misconceptions. Or if you're a fan of beating a metaphor to death (and hoo-baby, am I ever!), then this is the stuff that causes us to face the wrong direction and head down the wrong paths.
Misconception #1: Stories are special.
Very commonly, the way story is taught or positioned causes us to place it up on a pedestal, like some supernatural power we can deploy to have more impact or see greater results. And look, I get it. I feel a reverence for incredible stories and refreshing creativity. I can stare towards the horizon and fill my lungs with the sweet, sweet air of possibility too. Some stories ARE special.
But then, yanno ... most of them aren't. Most of them should just be regular old communication. But if we see them as special, then inevitably, we start to use them ONLY on special occasions.
	•	The monthly all-hands meeting.
	•	The company home page.
	•	The oft-promoted case study.
	•	The new podcast trailer.
	•	The big, important essay.
	•	The opening moments of a keynote.
That's the problem. This is not how to become a storyteller. This is how to, occasionally, tell a story.
Stories aren't for special occasions. Stories are just for ... occasions. Everywhere. All the time. Tell stories. You'll serve others better and so will be better served.
	•	When you start to face the path labeled ""Stories are special,"" remember to face a different way. Let's label that path ""Story Everywhere.""
Misconception #2: Stories are abstract.
Something that is ""abstract"" is something that is considered separate from you or the things you already know or consider tangible.
That's how we view this notion of ""story"" too. I get asked all the time on podcast interviews (he writes, understanding just how cringey and self-aggrandizing that may have sounded):
""So Jay, what are the benefits of story? Who should rely on story? How do we measure story?""
What, um ... what the actual hell are we talking about?
To me, that's like asking, ""What are the benefits of emotions? Should we use emotions?""
YES! That's just how we communicate. But just as marketers view ""emotions"" as only these extreme things (nope, they're implied or overtly communicated literally everywhere), marketers view ""story"" as these abstract things. It's all very much OUT THERE.
EMOTIONS!
STORY!
(Trumpets blare. Drums beat. Analytics go up-and-to-the-right.)
Abstract: existing in thought or as an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence.
The solution to this misconception? Prioritize existence. Let's make this more concrete, shall we?
	•	You experienced some stuff. Describe it.
	•	You felt some things while experiencing some stuff. Describe that too.
You have an idea. You ship the idea. It's concrete now. It exists.
Prioritize existence. Forget the abstractions.
The reason we don't do this more often is simple: the internet. (Ever heard of it?) It's both a gift and a curse to our creative causes. Let me explain...
Creative people understand the work in two phases across their lives: before and after we see ""the code of the Matrix."" In other words, our first attempts at anything are driven by gut feel. We only really sense the whole. It's only later that we start to notice the tiny parts, pieces, techniques, and frameworks that make up the whole -- which then unleashes a whole new level of creativity, as we are in greater control of the craft. It's like Neo from The Matrix movie, before and after he sees the code. When he does see it, he becomes a superhero, doing things others only wish they could do.
The internet has put much more of the ""code"" of the creative ""Matrix"" on full ""display."" (Quotes added because lists of two make me uncomfortable.) We can instantly access knowledge about the tiny parts, pieces, techniques, and frameworks immediately, everywhere, and for free. That level of access is great!
Also?
That level of access is intimidating!
Because we can see or hear others talking about all kinds of techniques and heuristics and philosophies and ups-and-downs to their work, we often get lost in it. Sometimes, it feels productive to consume this stuff. Meanwhile, we haven't produced anything. Other times, it doesn't feel productive; it feels horrifying. We think we MUST understand story structure and open loops and hooks and all these parts and pieces in order to become a worthy storyteller.
Poppycock.
That way of thinking is cock of the poppy.
(Don't be offended. ""Poppycock"" is from the Dutch word pappekak, meaning ""soft dung."" Oh, and speaking of words and creatures who poop a lot...)
Imagine if we tried to learn to speak like we try to learn storytelling. Imagine if, as little kids, we were told we had understand how to spell every word we'd say + the grammatical rules + the origins of the words + how to write them in straight lines and beautiful scripts ... all before we could speak them out loud.
We would never utter a word.
But what do we actually do? We just... start... speaking. We hear words, then we mimic them.
You've heard stories. So just... start... telling them.
If and when you get stuck, no problem. You can find a key to that door rather easily thanks to allllll that easily accessible information. But you don't need it to start or even elevate your work! You can simply start, learn, and keep going. All that advice should serve YOU, but way too often, it feels like we're trying to serve it. Don't try to find clarity to justify creating. Create to find clarity.
It's in the practice itself that we find our confidence, our personal techniques, our unique styles, and more. It's in the practice that we find ourselves. In waiting to practice until we learn the abstractions, we just end up removing ourselves. We arrive to the work full of everyone else's ideas for what we “have to do,” rather than listening to intuition.
If you want to feel confident or find clarity, just start making things. Tell stories. Then do it again. And again. And again.

"[all right welcome back and in this video we're going to chat about how to create some high value ebooks and how to do it pretty rapidly now there's a lot of different things that you can do with ebooks uh you could sell them you can give them away for free give them as a add-on or what we call a value bomb and a value bomb to me is is a very good way to use an ebook it essentially means that something you could sell it's very sellable and people would pay money for and you give it away for free they can build your email list
00:32
it can work as a opt-in offer for Facebook ads or whatever else you're using it for so let's just generate a quick and easy way to do this so I can show you how you might get some ideas for how you would apply this to your industry one of the things I like to do is to see if an ebook has a lot of value to it is jump over to Amazon and at Amazon we can look up any number of types of books and see if people are selling them and you could look at the amount of reviews how much volume they're moving Etc
01:06
so one of the things I thought of was that one of the easiest things to for chat GPT to do is to create lists so a list of people pay for lists are they really marketing blogs and so forth that have ideas on them so I went up here and of course this probably isn't the best prompt um but I put for example list books and the first thing that popped up was actually a sponsored ad and this book in particular says that it's 52 lists for happiness it's a weekly journaling inspiration for positively positivity balance and joy
01:40
so this individual is has created this book it was uploaded apparently on September 2016 and is paying with ads to put this in front of people on Amazon it sells for 9.74 cents and has majority five stars 2 810. so this is a sellable book so if we jump over here yep we can take a look inside and just kind of see what this book consists of so we can scroll through here it's 52 lists for happiness there's a little bit of you know graphic in here an intro section a picture a little bit more information it has a
02:25
table of contents and there's list list list list some images that make you happy list the things that you want out of life from five years this is a very simple looking book here now look at this list number one list what makes you happy right now and then there's just lines it's a journal and it has a little record here little um uh image and a take action so if you look at the outline of this book this is pretty simple stuff here to create so do you think you could create something like this pretty easily oh
03:00
yeah especially with chat GPT and also the help of an ebook designer that I'm going to show you here in a second so right off the bat here let's just go over here to chat GPT and let's see if we can generate things now just to save on time what I did is I created a new chat and what I asked it is I said write a list of 52 things to be happy about and without any problem chatgpt ripped out about 52 things that we could be happy about so that'll cover the weeks of the year once a week right so what I did also as I said I'm writing
03:41
an ebook with this list create an introduction for this book and no problem at all in this book we're going to explore 52 things blah blah blah so right off the bat we have an introduction for this book and we also have 52 things so we can also flesh this out further if we wanted to but I'm just to save time here I'm not going to go through all of that but we can model that same kind of structure don't copy people's books exactly but models the same structure and then add in some additional things
04:13
that would build some value and if you want to have a little uh prompt that will help is always go through the ratings if you go through the ratings on the books that's a lot of reviews to look at but look at some of the negative reviews and so forth and see what people complain about I wish this book had XYZ okay or I wish that uh this was included and that way you can upgrade what's out there existing and make it better so what we're going to do is we're going to take that list and that information
04:44
in there and we're going to go over to a website here called designr dot IO I'm going to include a link to this so don't worry but what this software does is it creates it basically Auto creates ebooks by taking your content and dropping it into the ebook with a template it is so simple it's ridiculous so here's the dashboard we can create an ebook and you can see here depending on the level of the software that you've got you can import from a blog post or a URL you can import from a docx Google doc
05:21
you can start from scratch some of these other ones are for example a PDF it'll turn it into a flip book which is awesome some of the other upgraded options I don't have access to this at the moment but you can import from a YouTube video imagine importing a YouTube video into an ebook that's crazy right that sounds awesome so what we're going to do just from the heck of it here is we're just going to start uh actually let's start with that template because I want to show you this and I've had some time to play with this
05:48
it's pretty awesome so we're going to start with the template we have all these different types of templates here right so we want to have something that's a little congruent with what we were just looking at okay so we can say let's see if there's some in self-development so in self-development we've got look at that finding your Center uh maintain happiness and then this one right here so let's actually just go to this so the cool thing about this software also is that it has these prompts it works
06:22
very much like a drag and drop website you could stick page numbers in there you can do all these things to make it really good okay so author name and stuff like that you can already you have a cover for the book okay so we could scroll down we've got a table of contents already in there so these can literally be our 52 ideas okay so we could stick those things in there that looks like the back end of the book we can design the middle of this so we can put the table of contents in there now if you want to design a new page all
06:56
we have to do is to stick that new page in there right and we can format that to look really good okay where's my prompt I can go like that okay so we can go two columns we can go to a chapter heading table contents Etc so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go regular and what we saw in there was those lines so we could see if we have an element that's close to that table of contents page breaks we've got a table in there it might look good as a table so you have to play with this a little bit I don't want to waste
07:30
too much time on the video with this but you can create columns and then get rid of some of the columns if you wanted to so that might be doable in order to uh create that effect that we want otherwise we could just draw a bunch of lines on the paper and then we can duplicate it 52 times to have all of the weeks of the year and then we can drop in some images so we have my images we have suggested images we can go in there like for example on the other one we saw a record player let's see if they have that
07:58
and of course yeah we've got stuff like this that we can drop in there right so it'll drop that text in there for I mean that image in there for us to help us with our design and we can move that around can we move it around it's not very movable is it let's make sure we do that oh there we go so we can move that around so you can see how unbelievably simple this is to create an ebook so we've got an ebook here that is sellable for nine dollars and 74 cents this book here and you can create an
08:32
eBay book version of this with a lot of value so there's a lot of different types of templates in here or ideas I think a couple of other ideas that I had seen in here was creating for example a travel type of thing so what I did here is I had because Valentine's Day is coming up so magical Valentine's adventures and I use the travel one and if you scroll down through here I had chat GPT actually come up with 52 ideas for Valentine's Day okay so there's a lot of those did I do 52 might be a 22 something like that
09:10
but we can use the travel outline Adventures travel Adventures so I'm just riffing here but you can see that these two things would be very easy to just create content after content and drop these value bombs for people using chat GPT in a list idea so take a look at this see if there's some list ideas that would work really well for you in terms of journaling inspiration or how-to guides or anything like that and you can create ebooks rapidly using design RR and chat GPT so I hope that spawned some new ideas for

so one of the things I thought of was that one of the easiest things to for chat GPT to do is to create lists so a list of people pay for lists are they really marketing blogs and so forth that have ideas on them so I went up here and of course this probably isn't the best prompt um but I put for example list books and the first thing that popped up was actually a sponsored ad and this book in particular says that it's 52 lists for happiness it's a weekly journaling inspiration for positively positivity balance and joy
01:40
so this individual is has created this book it was uploaded apparently on September 2016 and is paying with ads to put this in front of people on Amazon it sells for 9.74 cents and has majority five stars 2 810. so this is a sellable book so if we jump over here yep we can take a look inside and just kind of see what this book consists of so we can scroll through here it's 52 lists for happiness there's a little bit of you know graphic in here an intro section a picture a little bit more information it has a
02:25
table of contents and there's list list list list some images that make you happy list the things that you want out of life from five years this is a very simple looking book here now look at this list number one list what makes you happy right now and then there's just lines it's a journal and it has a little record here little um uh image and a take action so if you look at the outline of this book this is pretty simple stuff here to create so do you think you could create something like this pretty easily oh
03:00
yeah especially with chat GPT and also the help of an ebook designer that I'm going to show you here in a second so right off the bat here let's just go over here to chat GPT and let's see if we can generate things now just to save on time what I did is I created a new chat and what I asked it is I said write a list of 52 things to be happy about and without any problem chatgpt ripped out about 52 things that we could be happy about so that'll cover the weeks of the year once a week right so what I did also as I said I'm writing
03:41
an ebook with this list create an introduction for this book and no problem at all in this book we're going to explore 52 things blah blah blah so right off the bat we have an introduction for this book and we also have 52 things so we can also flesh this out further if we wanted to but I'm just to save time here I'm not going to go through all of that but we can model that same kind of structure don't copy people's books exactly but models the same structure and then add in some additional things
04:13
that would build some value and if you want to have a little uh prompt that will help is always go through the ratings if you go through the ratings on the books that's a lot of reviews to look at but look at some of the negative reviews and so forth and see what people complain about I wish this book had XYZ okay or I wish that uh this was included and that way you can upgrade what's out there existing and make it better so what we're going to do is we're going to take that list and that information
04:44
in there and we're going to go over to a website here called designr dot IO I'm going to include a link to this so don't worry but what this software does is it creates it basically Auto creates ebooks by taking your content and dropping it into the ebook with a template it is so simple it's ridiculous so here's the dashboard we can create an ebook and you can see here depending on the level of the software that you've got you can import from a blog post or a URL you can import from a docx Google doc
05:21
you can start from scratch some of these other ones are for example a PDF it'll turn it into a flip book which is awesome some of the other upgraded options I don't have access to this at the moment but you can import from a YouTube video imagine importing a YouTube video into an ebook that's crazy right that sounds awesome so what we're going to do just from the heck of it here is we're just going to start uh actually let's start with that template because I want to show you this and I've had some time to play with this
05:48
it's pretty awesome so we're going to start with the template we have all these different types of templates here right so we want to have something that's a little congruent with what we were just looking at okay so we can say let's see if there's some in self-development so in self-development we've got look at that finding your Center uh maintain happiness and then this one right here so let's actually just go to this so the cool thing about this software also is that it has these prompts it works
06:22
very much like a drag and drop website you could stick page numbers in there you can do all these things to make it really good okay so author name and stuff like that you can already you have a cover for the book okay so we could scroll down we've got a table of contents already in there so these can literally be our 52 ideas okay so we could stick those things in there that looks like the back end of the book we can design the middle of this so we can put the table of contents in there now if you want to design a new page all
06:56
we have to do is to stick that new page in there right and we can format that to look really good okay where's my prompt I can go like that okay so we can go two columns we can go to a chapter heading table contents Etc so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go regular and what we saw in there was those lines so we could see if we have an element that's close to that table of contents page breaks we've got a table in there it might look good as a table so you have to play with this a little bit I don't want to waste
07:30
too much time on the video with this but you can create columns and then get rid of some of the columns if you wanted to so that might be doable in order to uh create that effect that we want otherwise we could just draw a bunch of lines on the paper and then we can duplicate it 52 times to have all of the weeks of the year and then we can drop in some images so we have my images we have suggested images we can go in there like for example on the other one we saw a record player let's see if they have that
07:58
and of course yeah we've got stuff like this that we can drop in there right so it'll drop that text in there for I mean that image in there for us to help us with our design and we can move that around can we move it around it's not very movable is it let's make sure we do that oh there we go so we can move that around so you can see how unbelievably simple this is to create an ebook so we've got an ebook here that is sellable for nine dollars and 74 cents this book here and you can create an
08:32
eBay book version of this with a lot of value so there's a lot of different types of templates in here or ideas I think a couple of other ideas that I had seen in here was creating for example a travel type of thing so what I did here is I had because Valentine's Day is coming up so magical Valentine's adventures and I use the travel one and if you scroll down through here I had chat GPT actually come up with 52 ideas for Valentine's Day okay so there's a lot of those did I do 52 might be a 22 something like that
09:10
but we can use the travel outline Adventures travel Adventures so I'm just riffing here but you can see that these two things would be very easy to just create content after content and drop these value bombs for people using chat GPT in a list idea so take a look at this see if there's some list ideas that would work really well for you in terms of journaling inspiration or how-to guides or anything like that and you can create ebooks rapidly using design RR and chat GPT so I hope that spawned some new ideas for

to have anti-inflammatory effects and protect against many diseases but have you ever wondered what happens when you start eating carrots every day in this video we are going to be talking about the amazing health benefits of adding carrots to your diet before we proceed please note that everything mentioned in this video is unbiased fact checked and reviewed by qualified health professionals with that said let's jump in and talk about how carrots can improve our health number one strengthens your bones carrots play a huge role in keeping your bones strong as we age this is because it contains Vitamin K Vitamin K is an essential fat soluble vitamin that helps maintain bone density and prevent fractures it also helps form osteocalcin which is a protein that binds calcium ions in your bones this builds strong bones and prevents them from becoming brittle or fragile without enough vitamin K your body cannot use calcium that well this can lead to weak brittle bones or osteoporosis vitamin K also has been shown to help prevent coronary artery calcification which is the buildup of calcium in the arteries the same process that occurs in your bones happens in your arteries too as we get older arteries become stiffer and less flexible over time if you don't have enough vitamin K2 researchers at Tufts University recently discovered that eating more carrots can help build stronger bones by improving calcium absorption which can reduce the risk of osteoporosis for their study they put participants on a low calcium diet and measured how much calcium they absorbed over time then they had them eat one cup of carrot juice every day for two weeks to see if it would increase their bone mineral density the results were pretty impressive the participants who ate a cup of carrots each day experienced an eight percent increase in bone density after just two weeks this means that consuming extra carrots may help prevent osteoporosis and keep bones strong as we age number two improves Eye Health carrots are not only delicious but they can also be an excellent addition to your diet if you have eye problems carrots contain vitamin A and beta-carotene which

in our bodies increasing our risk for certain diseases like cancer and age-related macular degeneration number three helps reduce allergy flare-ups carrot protein has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties which can be beneficial for people who suffer from allergies they found that when a person is exposed to an allergen such as pollen an immune response is triggered by a type of white blood cells called t cells this causes inflammation which can cause symptoms such as sneezing and a runny nose in some cases it can lead to anaphylaxis or an extreme allergic reaction where the Airways become blocked however if someone has high levels of carotenoids in their blood their immune system will be less reactive and less likely to trigger an inflammatory response researchers from the University of Alberta investigated if this protein could affect asthma symptoms by experimenting on mice that were allergic to dust mites they found that those that were given carrot protein showed less severe lung inflammation than those who weren't fed the supplement the team believes that the reason for this is down to the anti-inflammatory properties of carrot protein which reduces swelling in tissues this means that when we eat carrots our bodies produce less histamine which is an inflammatory substance released during allergic reactions the researchers hope that these findings will lead to new treatments for people with allergies and asthma liking our video so far before we move on to the next benefit don't forget to hit the like button and subscribe to our

your bones this builds strong bones and prevents them from becoming brittle or fragile without enough vitamin K your body cannot use calcium that well this can lead to weak brittle bones or osteoporosis vitamin K also has been shown to help prevent coronary artery calcification which is the buildup of calcium in the arteries the same process that occurs in your bones happens in your arteries too as we get older arteries become stiffer and less flexible over time if you don't have enough vitamin K2 researchers at Tufts University recently discovered that eating more carrots can help build stronger bones by improving calcium absorption which can reduce the risk of osteoporosis for their study they put participants on a low calcium diet and measured how much calcium they absorbed over time then they had them eat one cup of carrot juice every day for two weeks to see if it would increase their bone mineral density the results were pretty impressive the participants who ate a cup of carrots each day experienced an eight percent increase in bone density after just two weeks this means that consuming extra carrots may help prevent osteoporosis and keep bones strong as we age number two improves Eye Health carrots are not only delicious but they can also be an excellent addition to your diet if you have eye problems carrots contain vitamin A and beta-carotene which

in our bodies increasing our risk for certain diseases like cancer and age-related macular degeneration number three helps reduce allergy flare-ups carrot protein has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties which can be beneficial for people who suffer from allergies they found that when a person is exposed to an allergen such as pollen an immune response is triggered by a type of white blood cells called t cells this causes inflammation which can cause symptoms such as sneezing and a runny nose in some cases it can lead to anaphylaxis or an extreme allergic reaction where the Airways become blocked however if someone has high levels of carotenoids in their blood their immune system will be less reactive and less likely to trigger an inflammatory response researchers from the University of Alberta investigated if this protein could affect asthma symptoms by experimenting on mice that were allergic to dust mites they found that those that were given carrot protein showed less severe lung inflammation than those who weren't fed the supplement the team believes that the reason for this is down to the anti-inflammatory properties of carrot protein which reduces swelling in tissues this means that when we eat carrots our bodies produce less histamine which is an inflammatory substance released during allergic reactions the researchers hope that these findings will lead to new treatments for people with allergies and asthma liking our video so far before we move on to the next benefit don't forget to hit the like button and subscribe to our

The final three episodes of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan's Netflix documentary series air on Thursday (Dec 15), with more criticism expected to be directed at the British royals just as King Charles and his family gather for a Christmas carol service.

In the first tranche of episodes released last week, Harry and Meghan again launched fierce attacks on the media over their treatment, some of which they said had been racist, but the royals themselves escaped relatively unscathed.

Trailers for the final shows indicate some more damning commentary on the Windsors, however, with Harry referring to ""institutional gaslighting"", and saying unspecified people had been ""happy to lie to protect my brother"", Prince William, who is now heir to the throne.

""They were never willing to tell the truth to protect us,"" Harry says.


Meghan's lawyer, Jenny Afia, and a friend were both shown in another trailer, saying how Buckingham Palace had briefed negative stories to the press about the couple to avoid unfavourable stories about other royals being printed.

""There was a real kind of war against Meghan,"" Afia said. Meanwhile newspapers have described the documentary series as the couple's war on the royals.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as Harry and Meghan are officially known, stepped down from royal duties in March 2020, saying they wanted to forge new lives in the United States away from media harassment, which the couple said had threatened to destroy their mental health.

""I wonder what would have happened to us had we not got out when we did,"" Harry says in a trailer. ""I said 'we need to get out of here',"" he adds, describing their exit as the ""freedom flight"".

HOSTILE PRESS

While the couple have won awards and plaudits from some across the Atlantic for their charitable and human rights work, back in Britain a hostile press accuses them of seeking to make millions from their royal status while constantly attacking the monarchy.

Newspapers have also cited former unnamed royal aides challenging the couple's narrative in the documentaries, saying there were inaccuracies in their accounts.

Both Buckingham Palace and William's office, Kensington Palace, have said they would not be commenting on the documentaries.

A royal source also said neither the palace nor representatives of William or other royals had been approached for comment for the series itself, contradicting a Netflix statement that said they had declined to comment.

According to initial figures cited by the BBC, some 2.4 million viewers in Britain watched the first episode on the day it was released, although the senior royals themselves have steered clear, royal sources have told newspapers.

Hours after the final three episodes are made available at 8am in Britain, Charles, his wife Camilla, Prince William and his wife Kate along with other royals will attend a carol service at London's Westminster Abbey to ""recognise the selfless efforts of individuals, families and communities across the UK"".

The service will also be dedicated to the late Queen Elizabeth, whose funeral was held in the Abbey in September.

"give me 5 bullets of the most important things from this:

What keeps us healthy and happy
0:15
as we go through life?
0:18
If you were going to invest now
0:21
in your future best self,
0:23
where would you put your time and your energy?
0:27
There was a recent survey of millennials
0:29
asking them what their most important life goals were,
0:34
and over 80 percent said
0:36
that a major life goal for them was to get rich.
0:40
And another 50 percent of those same young adults
0:45
said that another major life goal
0:47
was to become famous.
0:50
(Laughter)
0:52
And we're constantly told to lean in to work, to push harder
0:58
and achieve more.
1:00
We're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after
1:04
in order to have a good life.
1:06
Pictures of entire lives,
1:08
of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them,
1:13
those pictures are almost impossible to get.
1:18
Most of what we know about human life
1:21
we know from asking people to remember the past,
1:24
and as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20.
1:29
We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life,
1:33
and sometimes memory is downright creative.
1:36
But what if we could watch entire lives
1:41
as they unfold through time?
1:44
What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers
1:48
all the way into old age
1:50
to see what really keeps people happy and healthy?
1:55
We did that.
1:57
The Harvard Study of Adult Development
1:59
may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done.
2:05
For 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men,
2:13
year after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health,
2:17
and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories
2:22
were going to turn out.
2:25
Studies like this are exceedingly rare.
2:28
Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade
2:33
because too many people drop out of the study,
2:36
or funding for the research dries up,
2:39
or the researchers get distracted,
2:41
or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field.
2:46
But through a combination of luck
2:48
and the persistence of several generations of researchers,
2:52
this study has survived.
2:54
About 60 of our original 724 men
2:59
are still alive,
3:00
still participating in the study,
3:02
most of them in their 90s.
3:05
And we are now beginning to study
3:07
the more than 2,000 children of these men.
3:11
And I'm the fourth director of the study.
3:15
Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men.
3:20
The first group started in the study
3:22
when they were sophomores at Harvard College.
3:25
They all finished college during World War II,
3:27
and then most went off to serve in the war.
3:31
And the second group that we've followed
3:33
was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods,
3:37
boys who were chosen for the study
3:39
specifically because they were from some of the most troubled
3:43
and disadvantaged families
3:44
in the Boston of the 1930s.
3:47
Most lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water.
3:54
When they entered the study,
3:56
all of these teenagers were interviewed.
3:59
They were given medical exams.
4:01
We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents.
4:05
And then these teenagers grew up into adults
4:07
who entered all walks of life.
4:10
They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors,
4:16
one President of the United States.
4:20
Some developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia.
4:25
Some climbed the social ladder
4:27
from the bottom all the way to the very top,
4:30
and some made that journey in the opposite direction.
4:35
The founders of this study
4:38
would never in their wildest dreams
4:40
have imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later,
4:45
telling you that the study still continues.
4:49
Every two years, our patient and dedicated research staff
4:52
calls up our men and asks them if we can send them
4:56
yet one more set of questions about their lives.
5:00
Many of the inner city Boston men ask us,
5:03
""Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting.""
5:08
The Harvard men never ask that question.
5:11
(Laughter)
5:20
To get the clearest picture of these lives,
5:23
we don't just send them questionnaires.
5:26
We interview them in their living rooms.
5:29
We get their medical records from their doctors.
5:32
We draw their blood, we scan their brains,
5:34
we talk to their children.
5:36
We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns.
5:41
And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives
5:45
if they would join us as members of the study,
5:47
many of the women said, ""You know, it's about time.""
5:50
(Laughter)
5:51
So what have we learned?
5:53
What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages
5:58
of information that we've generated
6:01
on these lives?
6:03
Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder.
6:10
The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this:
6:16
Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.
6:23
We've learned three big lessons about relationships.
6:26
The first is that social connections are really good for us,
6:30
and that loneliness kills.
6:33
It turns out that people who are more socially connected
6:37
to family, to friends, to community,
6:40
are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer
6:45
than people who are less well connected.
6:48
And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.
6:51
People who are more isolated than they want to be from others
6:57
find that they are less happy,
7:00
their health declines earlier in midlife,
7:03
their brain functioning declines sooner
7:05
and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely.
7:10
And the sad fact is that at any given time,
7:13
more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.
7:19
And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd
7:21
and you can be lonely in a marriage,
7:24
so the second big lesson that we learned
7:26
is that it's not just the number of friends you have,
7:29
and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship,
7:33
but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters.
7:38
It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health.
7:43
High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection,
7:47
turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.
7:53
And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.
7:57
Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s,
8:01
we wanted to look back at them at midlife
8:04
and to see if we could predict
8:05
who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian
8:09
and who wasn't.
8:11
And when we gathered together everything we knew about them
8:15
at age 50,
8:18
it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels
8:20
that predicted how they were going to grow old.
8:23
It was how satisfied they were in their relationships.
8:27
The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50
8:31
were the healthiest at age 80.
8:35
And good, close relationships seem to buffer us
8:38
from some of the slings and arrows of getting old.
8:42
Our most happily partnered men and women
8:46
reported, in their 80s,
8:48
that on the days when they had more physical pain,
8:51
their mood stayed just as happy.
8:54
But the people who were in unhappy relationships,
8:57
on the days when they reported more physical pain,
9:00
it was magnified by more emotional pain.
9:04
And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health
9:08
is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies,
9:12
they protect our brains.
9:14
It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship
9:19
to another person in your 80s is protective,
9:23
that the people who are in relationships
9:25
where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need,
9:29
those people's memories stay sharper longer.
9:32
And the people in relationships
9:34
where they feel they really can't count on the other one,
9:37
those are the people who experience earlier memory decline.
9:42
And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time.
9:46
Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other
9:49
day in and day out,
9:51
but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other
9:54
when the going got tough,
9:56
those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.
10:01
So this message,
10:04
that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being,
10:10
this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.
10:13
Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore?
10:17
Well, we're human.
10:19
What we'd really like is a quick fix,
10:21
something we can get
10:23
that'll make our lives good and keep them that way.
10:27
Relationships are messy and they're complicated
10:30
and the hard work of tending to family and friends,
10:34
it's not sexy or glamorous.
10:37
It's also lifelong. It never ends.
10:40
The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement
10:45
were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates.
10:51
Just like the millennials in that recent survey,
10:54
many of our men when they were starting out as young adults
10:58
really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement
11:02
were what they needed to go after to have a good life.
11:06
But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown
11:10
that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships,
11:16
with family, with friends, with community.
11:21
So what about you?
11:23
Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60.
11:27
What might leaning in to relationships even look like?
11:31
Well, the possibilities are practically endless.
11:35
It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time
11:41
or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,
11:46
long walks or date nights,
11:49
or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years,
11:54
because those all-too-common family feuds
11:57
take a terrible toll
12:00
on the people who hold the grudges.
12:04
I'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain.
12:09
More than a century ago,
12:11
he was looking back on his life,
12:14
and he wrote this:
12:16
""There isn't time, so brief is life,
12:20
for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account.
12:26
There is only time for loving,
12:29
and but an instant, so to speak, for that.""
12:34
The good life is built with good relationships.

1:44
What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers
1:48
all the way into old age
1:50
to see what really keeps people happy and healthy?
1:55
We did that.
1:57
The Harvard Study of Adult Development
1:59
may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done.
2:05
For 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men,
2:13
year after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health,
2:17
and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories
2:22
were going to turn out.
2:25
Studies like this are exceedingly rare.
2:28
Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade
2:33
because too many people drop out of the study,
2:36
or funding for the research dries up,
2:39
or the researchers get distracted,
2:41
or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field.
2:46
But through a combination of luck
2:48
and the persistence of several generations of researchers,
2:52
this study has survived.
2:54
About 60 of our original 724 men
2:59
are still alive,
3:00
still participating in the study,
3:02
most of them in their 90s.
3:05
And we are now beginning to study
3:07
the more than 2,000 children of these men.
3:11
And I'm the fourth director of the study.
3:15
Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men.
3:20
The first group started in the study
3:22
when they were sophomores at Harvard College.
3:25
They all finished college during World War II,
3:27
and then most went off to serve in the war.
3:31
And the second group that we've followed
3:33
was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods,
3:37
boys who were chosen for the study
3:39
specifically because they were from some of the most troubled
3:43
and disadvantaged families
3:44
in the Boston of the 1930s.
3:47
Most lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water.
3:54
When they entered the study,
3:56
all of these teenagers were interviewed.
3:59
They were given medical exams.
4:01
We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents.
4:05
And then these teenagers grew up into adults
4:07
who entered all walks of life.
4:10
They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors,
4:16
one President of the United States.
4:20
Some developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia.
4:25
Some climbed the social ladder
4:27
from the bottom all the way to the very top,
4:30
and some made that journey in the opposite direction.
4:35
The founders of this study
4:38
would never in their wildest dreams
4:40
have imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later,
4:45
telling you that the study still continues.
4:49
Every two years, our patient and dedicated research staff
4:52
calls up our men and asks them if we can send them
4:56
yet one more set of questions about their lives.
5:00
Many of the inner city Boston men ask us,
5:03
""Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting.""
5:08
The Harvard men never ask that question.
5:11
(Laughter)
5:20
To get the clearest picture of these lives,
5:23
we don't just send them questionnaires.
5:26
We interview them in their living rooms.
5:29
We get their medical records from their doctors.
5:32
We draw their blood, we scan their brains,
5:34
we talk to their children.
5:36
We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns.
5:41
And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives
5:45
if they would join us as members of the study,
5:47
many of the women said, ""You know, it's about time.""
5:50
(Laughter)
5:51
So what have we learned?
5:53
What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages
5:58
of information that we've generated
6:01
on these lives?
6:03
Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder.
6:10
The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this:
6:16
Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.
6:23
We've learned three big lessons about relationships.
6:26
The first is that social connections are really good for us,
6:30
and that loneliness kills.
6:33
It turns out that people who are more socially connected
6:37
to family, to friends, to community,
6:40
are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer
6:45
than people who are less well connected.
6:48
And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.
6:51
People who are more isolated than they want to be from others
6:57
find that they are less happy,
7:00
their health declines earlier in midlife,
7:03
their brain functioning declines sooner
7:05
and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely.
7:10
And the sad fact is that at any given time,
7:13
more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.
7:19
And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd
7:21
and you can be lonely in a marriage,
7:24
so the second big lesson that we learned
7:26
is that it's not just the number of friends you have,
7:29
and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship,
7:33
but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters.
7:38
It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health.
7:43
High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection,
7:47
turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.
7:53
And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.
7:57
Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s,
8:01
we wanted to look back at them at midlife
8:04
and to see if we could predict
8:05
who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian
8:09
and who wasn't.
8:11
And when we gathered together everything we knew about them
8:15
at age 50,
8:18
it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels
8:20
that predicted how they were going to grow old.
8:23
It was how satisfied they were in their relationships.
8:27
The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50
8:31
were the healthiest at age 80.
8:35
And good, close relationships seem to buffer us
8:38
from some of the slings and arrows of getting old.
8:42
Our most happily partnered men and women
8:46
reported, in their 80s,
8:48
that on the days when they had more physical pain,
8:51
their mood stayed just as happy.
8:54
But the people who were in unhappy relationships,
8:57
on the days when they reported more physical pain,
9:00
it was magnified by more emotional pain.
9:04
And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health
9:08
is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies,
9:12
they protect our brains.
9:14
It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship
9:19
to another person in your 80s is protective,
9:23
that the people who are in relationships
9:25
where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need,
9:29
those people's memories stay sharper longer.
9:32
And the people in relationships
9:34
where they feel they really can't count on the other one,
9:37
those are the people who experience earlier memory decline.
9:42
And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time.
9:46
Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other
9:49
day in and day out,
9:51
but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other
9:54
when the going got tough,
9:56
those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.
10:01
So this message,
10:04
that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being,
10:10
this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.
10:13
Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore?
10:17
Well, we're human.
10:19
What we'd really like is a quick fix,
10:21
something we can get
10:23
that'll make our lives good and keep them that way.
10:27
Relationships are messy and they're complicated
10:30
and the hard work of tending to family and friends,
10:34
it's not sexy or glamorous.
10:37
It's also lifelong. It never ends.
10:40
The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement
10:45
were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates.
10:51
Just like the millennials in that recent survey,
10:54
many of our men when they were starting out as young adults
10:58
really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement
11:02
were what they needed to go after to have a good life.
11:06
But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown
11:10
that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships,
11:16
with family, with friends, with community.
11:21
So what about you?
11:23
Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60.
11:27
What might leaning in to relationships even look like?
11:31
Well, the possibilities are practically endless.
11:35
It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time
11:41
or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,
11:46
long walks or date nights,
11:49
or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years,
11:54
because those all-too-common family feuds
11:57
take a terrible toll
12:00
on the people who hold the grudges.
12:04
I'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain.
12:09
More than a century ago,
12:11
he was looking back on his life,
12:14
and he wrote this:
12:16
""There isn't time, so brief is life,
12:20
for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account.
12:26
There is only time for loving,
12:29
and but an instant, so to speak, for that.""
12:34
The good life is built with good relationships.

1:50
to see what really keeps people happy and healthy?
1:55
We did that.
1:57
The Harvard Study of Adult Development
1:59
may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done.
2:05
For 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men,
2:13
year after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health,
2:17
and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories
2:22
were going to turn out.
2:25
Studies like this are exceedingly rare.
2:28
Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade
2:33
because too many people drop out of the study,
2:36
or funding for the research dries up,
2:39
or the researchers get distracted,
2:41
or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field.
2:46
But through a combination of luck
2:48
and the persistence of several generations of researchers,
2:52
this study has survived.
2:54
About 60 of our original 724 men
2:59
are still alive,
3:00
still participating in the study,
3:02
most of them in their 90s.
3:05
And we are now beginning to study
3:07
the more than 2,000 children of these men.
3:11
And I'm the fourth director of the study.
3:15
Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men.
3:20
The first group started in the study
3:22
when they were sophomores at Harvard College.
3:25
They all finished college during World War II,
3:27
and then most went off to serve in the war.
3:31
And the second group that we've followed
3:33
was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods,
3:37
boys who were chosen for the study
3:39
specifically because they were from some of the most troubled
3:43
and disadvantaged families
3:44
in the Boston of the 1930s.
3:47
Most lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water.
3:54
When they entered the study,
3:56
all of these teenagers were interviewed.
3:59
They were given medical exams.
4:01
We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents.
4:05
And then these teenagers grew up into adults
4:07
who entered all walks of life.
4:10
They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors,
4:16
one President of the United States.
4:20
Some developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia.
4:25
Some climbed the social ladder
4:27
from the bottom all the way to the very top,
4:30
and some made that journey in the opposite direction.
4:35
The founders of this study
4:38
would never in their wildest dreams
4:40
have imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later,
4:45
telling you that the study still continues.
4:49
Every two years, our patient and dedicated research staff
4:52
calls up our men and asks them if we can send them
4:56
yet one more set of questions about their lives.
5:00
Many of the inner city Boston men ask us,
5:03
""Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting.""
5:08
The Harvard men never ask that question.
5:11
(Laughter)
5:20
To get the clearest picture of these lives,
5:23
we don't just send them questionnaires.
5:26
We interview them in their living rooms.
5:29
We get their medical records from their doctors.
5:32
We draw their blood, we scan their brains,
5:34
we talk to their children.
5:36
We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns.
5:41
And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives
5:45
if they would join us as members of the study,
5:47
many of the women said, ""You know, it's about time.""
5:50
(Laughter)
5:51
So what have we learned?
5:53
What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages
5:58
of information that we've generated
6:01
on these lives?
6:03
Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder.
6:10
The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this:
6:16
Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.
6:23
We've learned three big lessons about relationships.
6:26
The first is that social connections are really good for us,
6:30
and that loneliness kills.
6:33
It turns out that people who are more socially connected
6:37
to family, to friends, to community,
6:40
are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer
6:45
than people who are less well connected.
6:48
And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.
6:51
People who are more isolated than they want to be from others
6:57
find that they are less happy,
7:00
their health declines earlier in midlife,
7:03
their brain functioning declines sooner
7:05
and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely.
7:10
And the sad fact is that at any given time,
7:13
more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.
7:19
And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd
7:21
and you can be lonely in a marriage,
7:24
so the second big lesson that we learned
7:26
is that it's not just the number of friends you have,
7:29
and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship,
7:33
but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters.
7:38
It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health.
7:43
High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection,
7:47
turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.
7:53
And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.
7:57
Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s,
8:01
we wanted to look back at them at midlife
8:04
and to see if we could predict
8:05
who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian
8:09
and who wasn't.
8:11
And when we gathered together everything we knew about them
8:15
at age 50,
8:18
it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels
8:20
that predicted how they were going to grow old.
8:23
It was how satisfied they were in their relationships.
8:27
The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50
8:31
were the healthiest at age 80.
8:35
And good, close relationships seem to buffer us
8:38
from some of the slings and arrows of getting old.
8:42
Our most happily partnered men and women
8:46
reported, in their 80s,
8:48
that on the days when they had more physical pain,
8:51
their mood stayed just as happy.
8:54
But the people who were in unhappy relationships,
8:57
on the days when they reported more physical pain,
9:00
it was magnified by more emotional pain.
9:04
And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health
9:08
is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies,
9:12
they protect our brains.
9:14
It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship
9:19
to another person in your 80s is protective,
9:23
that the people who are in relationships
9:25
where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need,
9:29
those people's memories stay sharper longer.
9:32
And the people in relationships
9:34
where they feel they really can't count on the other one,
9:37
those are the people who experience earlier memory decline.
9:42
And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time.
9:46
Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other
9:49
day in and day out,
9:51
but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other
9:54
when the going got tough,
9:56
those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.
10:01
So this message,
10:04
that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being,
10:10
this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.
10:13
Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore?
10:17
Well, we're human.
10:19
What we'd really like is a quick fix,
10:21
something we can get
10:23
that'll make our lives good and keep them that way.
10:27
Relationships are messy and they're complicated
10:30
and the hard work of tending to family and friends,
10:34
it's not sexy or glamorous.
10:37
It's also lifelong. It never ends.
10:40
The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement
10:45
were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates.
10:51
Just like the millennials in that recent survey,
10:54
many of our men when they were starting out as young adults
10:58
really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement
11:02
were what they needed to go after to have a good life.
11:06
But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown
11:10
that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships,
11:16
with family, with friends, with community.
11:21
So what about you?
11:23
Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60.
11:27
What might leaning in to relationships even look like?
11:31
Well, the possibilities are practically endless.
11:35
It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time
11:41
or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,
11:46
long walks or date nights,
11:49
or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years,
11:54
because those all-too-common family feuds
11:57
take a terrible toll
12:00
on the people who hold the grudges.
12:04
I'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain.
12:09
More than a century ago,
12:11
he was looking back on his life,
12:14
and he wrote this:
12:16
""There isn't time, so brief is life,
12:20
for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account.
12:26
There is only time for loving,
12:29
and but an instant, so to speak, for that.""
12:34
The good life is built with good relationships.
12:39
Thank you.",base,0.3544519279616515

* i have wanted to move to Durham, NC going on many years, to leave the rat race and pace of NYC, and live close to family. However every time I explored work possibilites, the only kind of video production/editing/animation jobs were related to news or sports or some boring dry corporate thing. I got more serious about moving and searched more broadly but was discouraged I couldn’t find any video post produciton work that had any meaning to me. I basically gave up. Then one day I randomly decided to give it another shot and almost immeditely stumbled on a twitter tweet from a studio called dash in nearby Raliegh, who not only seemed like the first company I’d even consider, but on top of that they were announcing “Dash Bash”, an upcoming weekend “festival of motion design and animation, featuring talks from some of my favorite artists/animators. It seemed too good to be true. And that feeling only increased, as the “Bash” itself was so powerful and inspiring, breahting new life into my more and more jaded feedling about my career possibilities.

Use descriptive words that evoke a visceral sensory reaction. Keywords include: ""{Location} Vacation Rentals"", ""Hotels in {Location"", ""trip to {Location}"", and semantically similar terms.

The second Section is ""Nearby to {Location}"", which includes a preamble paragraph as well as a table that compares the Location against 3 other nearby locations, highlighting in 50 words why visitors may prefer the target Location against the comparison Locations (e.g. People may prefer {Location} because...)

The fourth Section is called, ""What People Say About {Location}"". These should be snippets about what tourists to that area would like about that location. The quotes should be italicized. Show different personas in each of these 4 snippets.

The fifth Section is called, ""The Best Time to Visit {Location}"" and should highlight the best time of year to visit the Location. Discuss the weather, festivals, or other highlights of a season.

The sixth Section is an FAQ section about the Location called ""FAQs About {Location}"", listing 6 common questions and answers.

"summarize this
EZRA KLEIN: See, but I think human beings are, in a weird way on this, bad on temporal reasoning, too, which is partially why I asked the question because let’s say you think the confidence interval here is somewhere between 20 and 100 years. That matters a lot for me. I’m probably not going to be around in 100 years, almost certainly. But in terms of human history, it’s nothing — 20 to 100 years just means really soon.

And if we do get here, it’s a really big, I mean, in some ways, event horizon. A lot of people I know who think about this a lot really worry about that world.

I was very both impressed and unnerved by another A.I. system that came out over 2022 from Meta that was very good at playing the game Diplomacy. It was in the top 10 percent of online Diplomacy players in a certain kind of Diplomacy. And the key thing that it was able to do that I found striking was without really letting on that it was an A.I. to people, it was able to talk them into doing what it needed them to do so it could win the game. It was able to trick people, which is fine. That was what it was told to do, created to do.

But as these things get way better — we’ve already talked about how convincing they can be, that in many ways are getting more convincing than they are anything else at the moment — they’re going to know so much. It’s weird because OpenAI, who we’ve been talking about forever here, they were started by a bunch of people worried about A.I. misalignment. And now they just keep creating more and more powerful A.I. systems, which is another interesting insight into human nature.

But do you worry about these alignment problems? Do you worry not just about the question of an A.I. ending the world or ending humanity, but just A.I.s, I don’t know, just causing huge amounts of damage, becoming weaponry, becoming — it’s a very powerful technology that we don’t really understand what’s happening in it. And we’re moving forward on it very fast.

GARY MARCUS: I do worry about the so-called alignment problem quite a bit. I’m not that worried about the kind of Terminator Skynet scenarios where machines take over the world because I don’t think they’re that interested in that. They’ve never shown any interest.

But I worry about the version of just any time you ask a machine to do something, if it doesn’t really understand who you are, it can misinterpret that request. So let’s put aside for the moment bad actors, but we should come back to that. And let’s put aside machines that are motivated to injure us, which I think is somewhat unlikely, and just talk about the big gray in between, where you ask a machine to do something and doesn’t understand your request.

So in “Rebooting A.I.,” we had the example of you ask a robot to tidy up your room and it winds up cutting up the couch and putting it in the closet because it doesn’t really know which things are important to you and which are not.

There’s, I think, a huge problem right now that we don’t know how to have machines interpret what human beings’ intents are. What is it they want, and all the things that they leave unsaid? And again, I worry that the dominant theme in the Silicon Valley right now is, well, we’ll solve these problems by making bigger sets of data. That’s not really working for truth. It’s not really going to work for intention, either, for having systems really understand our intent.

There’s a bullet that has to be bit, which is building models of what humans are saying and what they mean by those things. And that’s a serious challenge that requires rethinking how we do these things. Right now I don’t think we’re well-positioned to solve the alignment problem. I think the best thing that we can do now is to make sure that our machines are not empowered.

So the risks always come from a mixture of intelligence, or lack of intelligence, and power. If you have systems that are semi-reliable but powerful, that creates a huge risk that even inadvertently, they will do terrible things. So right now we have to come to grips with the fact that A.I. is more and more tempting to use because we can talk to it in English, and it can be witty at times and so forth, but isn’t really in a position where we can trust it.

And so we shouldn’t be giving it much rope. We can’t really be giving it that much opportunity to do things until we can be confident that it does understand the things that we’re asking. And I don’t see how to achieve that unless the systems have a lot of common ground with us. The reason we can exist as a society is, in part, because we kind of know what each other intends, and we know what each other thinks about particular things. We have common ground with them. And the robots, or the machines in general, don’t really have that with us yet.

Again, I don’t think it’s impossible. But it might be another thing that’s not entirely amenable to the big data paradigm. So you’re always, for example, going to have new things that you ask your machines. They might not be in your database, but you want them to handle them well.

And then the other problem is the big data paradigm is mostly about things that we can label, or we can label some of them or something like that. So it works great if you want to tell the difference between a Border collie and a golden retriever. It’s a constant stable thing in the world. You can label them. You can give examples.

But if I want to have a machine understand the difference between believing something and suspecting something, let’s say, it’s not clear, even what the data are, where if I want to tell a machine, don’t cause harm, I can label a bunch of pictures in which harm has taken place, but that’s not really getting across the concept of harm.

And so alignment is, in part, about having machines know that we have values like don’t harm people, be honest, be helpful. And we don’t really know how to communicate those in the big data paradigm.

And this is part of, again, why I come back to these hybrid models that have symbols. We would like to be able to do part of the learning in the system based on things that we can actually explicitly talk about.

By the way, a term we haven’t mentioned today is black box. So the current models are black box models. We don’t understand what’s happening inside of them. And we also can’t directly communicate with them and say, hey, I want you to follow this. So you can’t say at the beginning of a ChatGPT session and expect it to work, please only say true statements in what follows. It just won’t be able to respect that. It doesn’t really understand what you mean by say only true things. And it cannot constrain itself to only say true things.

You wish you could say to the system, don’t say anything that’s potentially harmful and have it compute, well, I’m going to give this medical advice, but I’m going to compute whether this is actually plausible. Or maybe I’ll even call in a human expert if I’m not sure if this is actually safe. We just don’t know how to program that in yet. Again, not impossible, but not part of the current technology.

And since our current technology does not allow us to directly specify any set of rules that we want to play by within our language systems, we have a problem right now.

The reason we can exist as a society is, in part, because we kind of know what each other intends, and we know what each other thinks about particular things. We have common ground with them. And the robots, or the machines in general, don’t really have that with us yet.

Again, I don’t think it’s impossible. But it might be another thing that’s not entirely amenable to the big data paradigm. So you’re always, for example, going to have new things that you ask your machines. They might not be in your database, but you want them to handle them well.

And then the other problem is the big data paradigm is mostly about things that we can label, or we can label some of them or something like that. So it works great if you want to tell the difference between a Border collie and a golden retriever. It’s a constant stable thing in the world. You can label them. You can give examples.

But if I want to have a machine understand the difference between believing something and suspecting something, let’s say, it’s not clear, even what the data are, where if I want to tell a machine, don’t cause harm, I can label a bunch of pictures in which harm has taken place, but that’s not really getting across the concept of harm.

And so alignment is, in part, about having machines know that we have values like don’t harm people, be honest, be helpful. And we don’t really know how to communicate those in the big data paradigm.

And this is part of, again, why I come back to these hybrid models that have symbols. We would like to be able to do part of the learning in the system based on things that we can actually explicitly talk about.

By the way, a term we haven’t mentioned today is black box. So the current models are black box models. We don’t understand what’s happening inside of them. And we also can’t directly communicate with them and say, hey, I want you to follow this. So you can’t say at the beginning of a ChatGPT session and expect it to work, please only say true statements in what follows. It just won’t be able to respect that. It doesn’t really understand what you mean by say only true things. And it cannot constrain itself to only say true things.

You wish you could say to the system, don’t say anything that’s potentially harmful and have it compute, well, I’m going to give this medical advice, but I’m going to compute whether this is actually plausible. Or maybe I’ll even call in a human expert if I’m not sure if this is actually safe. We just don’t know how to program that in yet. Again, not impossible, but not part of the current technology.

And since our current technology does not allow us to directly specify any set of rules that we want to play by within our language systems, we have a problem right now.

"summarize this
EZRA KLEIN: See, but I think human beings are, in a weird way on this, bad on temporal reasoning, too, which is partially why I asked the question because let’s say you think the confidence interval here is somewhere between 20 and 100 years. That matters a lot for me. I’m probably not going to be around in 100 years, almost certainly. But in terms of human history, it’s nothing — 20 to 100 years just means really soon.

And if we do get here, it’s a really big, I mean, in some ways, event horizon. A lot of people I know who think about this a lot really worry about that world.

I was very both impressed and unnerved by another A.I. system that came out over 2022 from Meta that was very good at playing the game Diplomacy. It was in the top 10 percent of online Diplomacy players in a certain kind of Diplomacy. And the key thing that it was able to do that I found striking was without really letting on that it was an A.I. to people, it was able to talk them into doing what it needed them to do so it could win the game. It was able to trick people, which is fine. That was what it was told to do, created to do.

But as these things get way better — we’ve already talked about how convincing they can be, that in many ways are getting more convincing than they are anything else at the moment — they’re going to know so much. It’s weird because OpenAI, who we’ve been talking about forever here, they were started by a bunch of people worried about A.I. misalignment. And now they just keep creating more and more powerful A.I. systems, which is another interesting insight into human nature.

But do you worry about these alignment problems? Do you worry not just about the question of an A.I. ending the world or ending humanity, but just A.I.s, I don’t know, just causing huge amounts of damage, becoming weaponry, becoming — it’s a very powerful technology that we don’t really understand what’s happening in it. And we’re moving forward on it very fast.

GARY MARCUS: I do worry about the so-called alignment problem quite a bit. I’m not that worried about the kind of Terminator Skynet scenarios where machines take over the world because I don’t think they’re that interested in that. They’ve never shown any interest.

But I worry about the version of just any time you ask a machine to do something, if it doesn’t really understand who you are, it can misinterpret that request. So let’s put aside for the moment bad actors, but we should come back to that. And let’s put aside machines that are motivated to injure us, which I think is somewhat unlikely, and just talk about the big gray in between, where you ask a machine to do something and doesn’t understand your request.

So in “Rebooting A.I.,” we had the example of you ask a robot to tidy up your room and it winds up cutting up the couch and putting it in the closet because it doesn’t really know which things are important to you and which are not.

There’s, I think, a huge problem right now that we don’t know how to have machines interpret what human beings’ intents are. What is it they want, and all the things that they leave unsaid? And again, I worry that the dominant theme in the Silicon Valley right now is, well, we’ll solve these problems by making bigger sets of data. That’s not really working for truth. It’s not really going to work for intention, either, for having systems really understand our intent.

There’s a bullet that has to be bit, which is building models of what humans are saying and what they mean by those things. And that’s a serious challenge that requires rethinking how we do these things. Right now I don’t think we’re well-positioned to solve the alignment problem. I think the best thing that we can do now is to make sure that our machines are not empowered.

So the risks always come from a mixture of intelligence, or lack of intelligence, and power. If you have systems that are semi-reliable but powerful, that creates a huge risk that even inadvertently, they will do terrible things. So right now we have to come to grips with the fact that A.I. is more and more tempting to use because we can talk to it in English, and it can be witty at times and so forth, but isn’t really in a position where we can trust it.

And so we shouldn’t be giving it much rope. We can’t really be giving it that much opportunity to do things until we can be confident that it does understand the things that we’re asking. And I don’t see how to achieve that unless the systems have a lot of common ground with us.

Remove most achievements-- pick maybe just one relevant achievement and quickly mention it
expand on my story, maybe about me returning to the piano piece and finally playing it well
talk also more about what I learned from my experience
discuss more about answering the question, the ""that is not a weakness, that is life""
(small mistakes of life - imperfections make life perfect?)
(if a robot painted a painting it might not be perfect)
